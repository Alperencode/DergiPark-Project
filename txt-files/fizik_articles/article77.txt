appreciate technical and vocational education as important for an economically
and socially sustainable development. In this context, many studies focus on
increasing the quality of technical and vocational education. The aim of this
study is to evaluate the contribution of physics courses to the fundamental electronics
and measurement course in vocational high schools in the context of curriculum
and teacher opinions. The data were obtained through semi-structured interviews
conducted with teachers in vocational high schools and by comparing the
programs of the physics and fundamental electronic-measurement courses in the
context of document analysis. The data obtained from interviews were analyzed
descriptively. Findings of the research showed that the examined courses in
vocational high schools were not planned as supporting each other. Especially
the expressions of participant teachers revealed that difficulties arose in
teaching the courses which require physics knowledge such as fundamental
electronics and measurement course in vocational high schools.
