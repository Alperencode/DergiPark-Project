Makale Baþlýðý Analysis Of The Compatibility Of Scientific Experimental Setup In Galleries Of Kocaeli Science Center With Secondary Education Physics Course Curriculum

Öz
Science centers in Turkey have significant roles in informal science education learning environments since 2000s. Kocaeli Science Center which is affiliated unit to Kocaeli Metropolitan Municipality with the cooperation of TUBITAK, opened on 18 April, 2015, is one of the first examples of its field and is one of the most comprehensive one of all. In this study conducted in Kocaeli Science Center which operates as an informal educational environment, T.C. The Ministry of National Education Secondary Education Physics Course Curriculum was examined and experimental setups related to subjects of physics in the gallery areas were determined. The scientific experimental setups in the Kocaeli Science Center were matched with the units and topics included in the Curriculum, and their compatibility with each other was examined. It has been observed that a significant harmony has been achieved as a result of the study. The study was supported with Miles and Huberman (1994) Qualitative Data Analysis. The fact that this study has not been unconstructed before makes the analysis more significant. This study is intended to use as a guide for people who do academic studies related to physics, especially high school physics teachers, in order to use informal science educational environments more actively.
