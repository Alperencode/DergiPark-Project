Makale Baþlýðý A Settlement Experience on Protection of Physical Identity and Image Enhancement: The Example of Osmaneli (Bilecik)

Öz
Intense movement in the urbanization, devilish consumption, unconscious usage of energy sources, migration of people to big cities for any reason and rapid growth in the population can be counted as the common problems of the recent cities. Some local administrations in Italy, which became aware of problems about cities, initiated a movement called Slow City Movement (Cittaslow Movement) in 1999. Primary objective of the Slow City Movement is to feed the development of the spaces being predicated on the better food, sustainable economy, healthy environments, and traditional rituals of the social life. Slow city candidate cities show activity to support modern industry which their products define and give identity to the region as well as to encourage local art and craft. To protect the characteristics of built environment, planting trees, increasing the amount of green spaces, bicycle paths and pedestrianized areas, to decontaminate squares from billboards and neon, to forbid car alarms, to reduce noise pollution, light pollution and air pollution, to support alternative energy use, to develop public transport and eco-friendly architecture in new regulations are also some of mandatory implementations of Slow Cities.Bilecik has a significant location; geographically, as it is close to major cities, such as Ankara, Istanbul, Eskiþehir, Bursa and historically; hosting of various civilizations and serving as a center for the establishment of the Ottoman Empire and its struggle in the War of Independence. The aim of the study is to examine the suitability of Osmaneli city to participate the Slow City Movement as a member and to determine the positive physical effects of participating to the Slow City Movement towards improving the city image and also to develop design suggestions for the district.
