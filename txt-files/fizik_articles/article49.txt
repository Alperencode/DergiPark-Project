Makale Baþlýðý Comparison of Example Types Used in 9th Grade Physics Textbooks: The Energy Unit

Öz
In this study, it is aimed to determine the example types used in the energy unit in the 9th grade physics textbook. Example types used in the energy unit were analyzed according to the classification developed by Alkan (2016) and consisting of startup, standard, improving, non-example, extreme and counter examples. The method of the study was document analysis and two textbooks that were approved by the Board of Education and Discipline for the physics lesson in the 2018-2019 academic year were examined. 65 examples were identified in the energy unit in the fisrt textbook (TB1). It was determined that 35 of these examples belong to startup, 21 to standard, 24 to improving, 3 to non-example and 5 to counter example types. In the second textbook (TB2), 62 examples were identified and it was observed that 27 of these examples belong to the startup, 9 to standard, 32 to improving, 4 to the non-example and 4 to counter example types. It has been determined that there are no extreme examples in either of these two textbooks. The 9th grade is the level at which students enter physics teaching. In this respect, it is expected that the number of initial and standard examples to be high. It is recommended to examine the subjects of other units in the physics curriculum in terms of example types.
