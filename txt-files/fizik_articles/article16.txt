Makale Baþlýðý Investigation of the Physico-Mechanical, Chemical and Mineralogical-Petrographic Properties of Ulubey (Usak) White Marbles

Öz
Uþak region is located in Menderes Massif where has a significant marble potential. Standards play an important role in determination of using areas of marbles and identifying their suitability in these areas. In this study, the samples are collected from different marble quarries in the region in order to determining physico-mechanical, chemical, mineralogical-petrographic properties of marbles in Ulubey (Uþak) when the samples have been prepared in marble factories with the TSE standards, properties of the marbles are also determined in accordance with the standards. These properties are compared with the standard values of TS 1910, TS 2513 and TS 10449 in order to determine their usage as natural building blocks. It has been determined that the physicomechanical properties of the samples are taken from each of the three fields provided the limit values specified in the three standards which are compared in this study, excluding the fullness rate. According to TS 10449 standard, the fullness rate should be at least 98%. The fullness rate of the marbles in the study area has been calculated to be between 93.40-98.35%. According to the mineralogical-petrographic investigations made on Ulubey White marbles, it was determined that the marbles consist of calcite minerals with well-developed polysynthetic twinning showing granoblastic texture. According to the grain size measurements made in calcite minerals, it has been observed that the grain size varies between 147.7 µm and 3150 µm.
