Makale Baþlýðý Some physical properties and permeability of irrigated soils in South - Kazakhstan

Öz
This study reveals that some physical properties and permeability of irrigated lands in the Southern Regions of Kazakhstan. Thedeficiency of irrigation water increases every year under the current climate conditions and in connection with global climatechange. It is important to know the physical properties of the soils in irrigated land conditions while developing the irrigationregime and water saving technology because the growth conditions of cultivated plants and soil microorganisms are largelydependent on water. Methods of soil tillage, terms and norms of irrigating cultivated crops, and many other factors are under theeffect of soil physical properties. Sierozem soils containing 1.38% organic matter, low N and P contents and medium K content in 0-30 cm of the land where this study was conducted, are suitable for the cultivation of many plants. In the soil samples taken along theprofile in the experimental area, the hygroscopic moisture constants are between 4.55% - 4.71%, the bulk density is between 1.46 -1.58 g/cm3, the total porosity is between 41.5% - 42.7% and the soil lower gravimetric moisture content varied between 21.4% and22.6%. Also, it has been found that 100 mm irrigation water applied to the soil can infiltrate more than 24 h (24.6 - 27.0 hours)
