Makale Baþlýðý A Research on The Study of Physical Activity Motor Skills and Attention Levels in Children

Öz
The aim of this study was to determine the motor skills (MS), physical activity levels (PAL) and attention levels (AL) of 11-year-old children and to examine the relationship between these variables. A total of 222 volunteer children, 101 boys and 121 girls aged 11, participated in the study. In the study, the PAL of the children were determined with the Physical Activity Questionnare for Older Children PAQ-C, the MS, the big muscle skills measurement test (BMST) and the AL with the D2 attention test. Percentage and frequency values of the data on the PAL, MS and AL of the children were used and the relationship between PAL, MS and AL was determined by Pearson correlation analysis. According to the analysis results, 78.2% of the men in the categorization of MS; 74.4% of the girls are in the below average, bad and very bad category; In the categorization of AL, 49.5% of men; 20.7% of the girls were found to be in the bad and intermediate category. While there was no significant relationship between the PAL and AL of the participants, a positive significant relationship was determined between the PAL and locomotor skill. In addition, a significant relationship was determined between MS and AL parameters. In addition, a significant relationship was found between the MS and AL parameters. As a result, in cases where it is desired to improve the basic motor skills and attention levels of children, it may be recommended to direct them to games and sports activities that include physical activities.
