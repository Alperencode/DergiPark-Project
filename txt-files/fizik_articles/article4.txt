Makale Baþlýðý Physicochemical and Phytochemical Properties Kumquat Jams Produced with Whole Fruits and Small Pieces of Fruits

Öz
In this study, kumquat jams were produced from whole fruits and small pieces of fruits. Kumquat fruits of the “Nagami” variety (Fortunella margarita Swingle) were used in jam production. The traditional method was used in the jam processing. Jams were analyzed for total dry matter, total soluble solids, pH, titration acidity, water activity, color properties, total phenolic matter content, total flavonoid content, ascorbic acid content, organic acids, sugars and antioxidant activity [2,2-diphenyl-1picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC)]. The ranges for the total dry matter, water soluble dry matter, water activity, pH and titratable acidity values of kumquat jams were determined as 75.36-76.35 g/100 g, 70.25-70.32°Bx, 0.803-0.809, 3.39-3.43 and 0.40-0.55%, respectively. The ranges for glucose, fructose, sucrose and total sugar contents of the jam samples were 20.35-20.61 g/100 g, 28.54-28.56 g/100 g, 20.70-20.75 g/100 g and 69.64-69.87 g/100 g, respectively. Citric (0.15-0.19 g/100 g) and oxalic (0.08-0.14 g/100 g) acids were the major organic acids in jam samples. In general, the highest total phenolic matter (87.79 mg GAE/ 100 g), total flavonoid (37.71 mg CE/100 g), ascorbic acid contents (108.33 mg/100 g), IC50 (630.44 mg/mg) and ORAC (33.22 µmol TE/g) values were determined in kumquat jam samples produced with whole fruits.
