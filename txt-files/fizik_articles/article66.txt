Makale Baþlýðý The relationship between air quality and physical environment of Inegol (Bursa) basin

Öz
The study investigates the air pollution problems of Inegol, which have reached such an extent in recent years. It has an impact on human health. This is a scientific problem in terms of sustainable use. Purpose of the research; to examine the relationship between air quality and physical environment of Inegol and determine the physical geography factors that shape the air quality characteristics, starting from the winter period November 2016 by February 2017. To examine the air quality, PM10 ve SO2 data determined as pollutants from the MoEU were obtained and a temperature measurement station was established at four different elevations (284 m, 316 m, 426 m, 827 m) on the basin. With these data, it was determined that inversion developed on the basin. This inversions develop depending on the weather type have become stronger with the effect of the topography. In the shaping of the air quality in Inegol, the physical environment and the amount of pollutants are determinant. Inegol established on the basin floor. A factor creates an environment for the low air quality. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of the physical environment in land use and planning in order to solve the determined problem.
