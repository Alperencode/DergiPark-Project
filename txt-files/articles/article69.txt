Makale Baþlýðý: Teacher's Views on Distance Education in Turkish Teaching
Özet: 
Öz
This study has been designed to examine practices in distance education in terms of Turkish teaching in line with the teachers' views. This study is a case study. The study group consists of 25 Turkish teachers working in various secondary schools in the province of Siirt. The semi-structured interview form was used as a data collection tool. The data were analysed via the content analysis method through the Maxqda Qualitative Analysis program. The findings revealed that the activities regarding listening, speaking, and reading skills as part of the Turkish teaching lesson in distance education were productive, but little improvement was observed in writing skills and there were problems such as lack of equal opportunities and disruptions arising from technological infrastructure. It was also observed that students with opportunities had more interest in lessons. In the South-eastern Anatolia Region, where it is very difficult to apply distance education, teachers continue to encourage students in both digital and face-to-face environments to prevent the interruption of education.
