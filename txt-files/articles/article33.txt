Özet: 
Öz
The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes, views and opportunities of social studies teachers in regard to the use of the historical environment in social studies courses, and to develop suggestions that can help overcome the obstacles to teaching in the historical environment. First of all, a comprehensive literature review within the scope of the study was made and the possible didactic benefits and contributions of the historical environment to teaching in general and to history teaching in particular were presented. Subsequently, a data collection tool suitable for the semi-structured interview technique was developed by using the literature findings and expert opinions. The data collection tool was then applied to 14 Social Studies teachers working in six different secondary schools in Çanakkale in the 2018-2019 academic year, and the findings were conceptualized within the framework of our research questions and categorized as (i) knowledge and awareness, (ii) attitudes and (iii) opinions about teaching in the historical environment. The findings were discussed in comparison with the findings from the relevant literature, and a series of suggestions have been made that could contribute to the prospective studies of individuals and institutions that could be interested in teaching in the historical environment.
