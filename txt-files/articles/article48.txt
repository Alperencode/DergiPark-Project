Öz
Introduction: Retroperitoneal hemorrhage has been reported with enoxaparin therapy. Ýn this article, spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage developed in a patient using enoxaparin due to deep vein thrombosis is discussed.
Case Report: A seventy-six-year-old male patient was admitted to the emergency department with the complaint of fatigue. On deeper introspection, our patient had, in the recent past, been used enoxaparin for  deep vein thrombosis. In the physical examination was natural except subcutaneous minimal hematoma in the upper extremity bilateral enoxaparin area. Ýn laboratory tests, hemoglobin: 4.6 g / dl, urea: 158 mg / dl and creatinine were determined as 1.86 mg / dl. Abdominopelvic computed tomography imaging were performed and retroperitoneal hemorrhage reaching a depth of 4 cm adjacent to the right psoas muscle was detected. The patient, who did not develop additional complications after FFP and erythrocyte suspension replacement during the intensive care follow-ups and did not need surgical treatment, was discharged on the 17th day of his hospitalization in good health.
 Conclusion: When patients under enoxoparine treatment present with the complaint of fatigue, major bleeding may be seen when anemia is detected. One should be vigilant in terms of retroperitoneal bleeding as the bleeding focus in these patients.
