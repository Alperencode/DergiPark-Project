PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the results and necessity of the consultations by examining the patients who were consulted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic from the Emergency Department (ED). 
METHODS: We retrospectively scanned the data of patients who were consulted to the Gynecology and Obstetrics clinic from the ED between January 2019 and June 2020. The patients' age, complaints at the time of admission to the ED, initial diagnoses, comorbidities, obstetric characteristics and gestational weeks of pregnant women, reasons for consultation, surgical operations performed, radiological and laboratory tests, outcomes in the ED (discharge, hospitalization, exitus, referral) were recorded.
RESULTS:17.9% of the patients were consulted for gynecological reasons and 82.1% for obstetric reasons. The most common reason due to obstetric reasons was labor pain (25.50%). The second most common reason was pelvic pain (20.51%). We found that 14.7% of the patients gave birth and 4.6% had emergency surgery. 30.6% of the patients consulted from the ED were referred to gynecology and obstetrics outpatient clinic. No Obstetrics and Gynecology pathology was found in 15% of the patients.
CONCLUSÝON: Consultations process have a crucial place in the ED. Organizing training programs in institutions that train specialist physicians and organizing the consultation process with inter-clinic meetings can prevent unnecessary consultations.
