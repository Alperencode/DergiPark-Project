Özet: 
Öz
The pre-school education process is one of the most important stages of the education system because the children and their families become a part of the formal education institution for the first time. The purpose of this study is to examine the correlation between the communication skills of preschool teachers and the communication established among the families, school management and teachers, as well as cooperation, expectations, and involvement of families. The sample of the study consists of 112 teachers who were determined using the simple random sampling method. In the research, "Demographic Information Questionnaire", "Communication Skills Scale - Adult Questionnaire", "Communication and Cooperation between Family and Teacher Scale”, and "Student-Teacher Relationship Scale" were used as data collection tools. The correlation between teacher communication skill scores and communication and cooperation between family sub-scale scores as well as student-teacher relationship scores was analyzed using the Pearson correlation test. As a result of the study, a positive and significant correlation was found between the communication skills of the preschool teachers and the student-teacher relationship, as well as communication of the family with the school management and the teachers during the preschool period, the cooperation and expectations of the family regarding the school and the teacher, and the level of family involvement in the education process. Based on the results of the research, improving the communication skills of teachers is considered important both for the involvement of families in the education process and for the improvement of the relationship between students and teachers.
