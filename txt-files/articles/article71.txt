Makale Baþlýðý: An Assessment of Critical Naming in the Aqaid Literature of Ahl al-Hadith
Özet: 
Öz
This article aims to identify and analyze some critical naming in the aqaid literature of Ahl al-hadith scholars of the first three centuries of Hijra. Towards the end of the Umayyad state, hadith scholars have written several books in order to struggle sects they consider heretical. In these works, it is seen that they characterize the individuals and groups they criticize by various names. While some of the names clearly reflect the identity of their interlocutors, -as in Ahl al-bid'at naming- there is uncertainty as to who some of them it is used for. In this article, some names whose interlocutor is not definitively understood are identified in the use of Ahl al-hadith. It is also debated in which contexts these namings are used.
