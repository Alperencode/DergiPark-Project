Öz
The main purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between pre-service early childhood teachers’ environmental education self-efficacy beliefs and their attitudes towards sustainable environment. This research was conducted with a total of 129 pre-service early childhood teachers in a public university of Ankara, Turkey. To collect the data of pre-service teachers’ attitudes toward sustainable environment, Sustainable Environment Attitude Scale (SEAS) was employed. Besides, Environmental Education Self-Efficacy Scale (EESS) was used to identify pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs about environmental education. To analyze the data, independent sample t-test analysis was conducted for comparison of groups. Moreover, one-way analysis of variances (ANOVA) was executed for contrasting groups in terms of grade level. Lastly, the Pearson’s correlation was employed to investigate the relationship between environmental education self-efficacy beliefs and sustainable environment attitudes. Results showed that there is a statistically significant relationship between pre-service teachers’ environmental education self-efficacy beliefs and their attitudes toward sustainable environment.
