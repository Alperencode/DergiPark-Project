Özet: 
Öz
This research aims to determine the studies related to the instructional adaptation of Turkish language teachers who have inclusive students. The sample of the research is composed of 31 Turkish language teachers who work in a secondary school in Konya and its districts and have an inclusive student. The case study method, one of the qualitative research approaches, was used in the study. Semi-structured interview questions were used as data collection tools in the study. The data obtained from the semi-structured interview questions were analyzed by descriptive analysis. When the research findings are examined, it is seen that most of the teachers have not received any training on inclusion practices and instructional adaptations. For this reason, it was concluded that teachers had problems arising from a lack of knowledge about instructional adaptation. These problems; focus on making physical arrangements, making instructional adaptations, and organizing the teaching process. For Turkish language teachers, it is recommended to provide training on material development, measurement and evaluation, and effective time management before teaching, in the presentation of the teaching, on the adaptations to be made at the end of the teaching.
