Makale Baþlýðý: MIDDLE SCHOOL MATHEMATICS TEACHERS' PERCEPTIONS ABOUT REFORM CURRICULUM
Özet: 
Öz
In this phenomenology study, it was aimed to define and explain the perceptions of middle school mathematics teachers regarding the phenomenon of curriculum and the new mathematics curriculum being implemented in Turkey in the field of mathematics education in recent years. Twelve middle school mathematics teachers working in the state schools of a province in Turkey were included in the study. The data were obtained through semi-structured interviews. The data obtained from the interviews were analyzed by content analysis method. The findings indicate that the awareness of the middle school mathematics teachers regarding the role and importance of the curriculum phenomenon in their professional life and development is low. On the other hand, it has been determined that their perceptions of the ideal mathematics curriculum are compatible with the innovations introduced in the reform programs. Therefore, this study concluded that middle school mathematics teachers believed in the necessity and importance of the reform programs. However, they revealed negative feelings and evaluations about the implementation of the mathematics reform programs. They labeled the mathematics reform programs as worthless, unreliable and worrying for various reasons such as being incompatible with the assessment and evaluation system focused on test success and changing frequently. These contradictory findings point to the lack of curriculum knowledge of middle school mathematics teachers.
