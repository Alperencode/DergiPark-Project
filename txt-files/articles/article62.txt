Öz
In this study, the relationship between students' attitudes towards Turkish course and their perceptions of classroom assessment environment was examined.The study group in the study was composed of a total of 150 students, 89 girls and 61 boys, selected from two different secondary schools in the center of Diyarbakýr in the 2017-2018 academic year.  Within the scope of the research, the Attitude Scale towards Turkish lesson developed by Kapar Kuvanç (2008) and the Classroom Evaluation Atmosphere Scale developed by Çetin and Ýlhan (2014) were used as data collection tools.  The Pearson Product Moment correlation and regression analysis were used to analyze the research data.  As a result of correlation analysis, a positive and significant relationship was found between learning-oriented assessment atmosphere and attitude towards Turkish course. On the other hand, it has been determined that the performance-oriented assessment atmosphere has a negative significant relationship with the attitude towards Turkish course. The findings obtained from the regression analysis showed that 25% of the total variance related to students' attitudes towards Turkish course can be explained by their perceptions of the classroom assessment atmosphere.
