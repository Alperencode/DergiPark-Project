Özet: 
Öz
This study aims to reveal the definition of terms ‘ecole, style, individual characteristics and interpretation’, which are used in Turkish Music, according to the opinions of academicians specialized in the field of Turkish Music. The maximum variation sampling method was employed in the study, which was conducted through a qualitative descriptive research design. A semi-structured interview method was used for the collection of data in this study. The data acquired by this research was subject to content analysis via ATLAS.ti 8 software. The results of the study revealed that the terms ‘style’ and ‘individual characteristics’ were defined and understood differently both in the literature and by the participants forming the study group of research; on the other hand, usually similar definitions were made for the terms ‘ecole’ and ‘interpretation’. For the avoidance of the contradiction in terms which is leading to problems in the terminology of Turkish Music, it is recommended that clear definitions be made for the mentioned terms through workshops by specialists of the field, such as music teachers, social psychologists, social-cultural anthropologists, ethnologists, music sociologists, music philosophers, and linguists.
