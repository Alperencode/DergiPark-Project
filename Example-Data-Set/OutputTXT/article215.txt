Makale Başlığı: An Investigation On the Ottoman Social Stratification and Its Effects on Nineteenth Century Constitutional Developments
Özet: This paper aims to make a contribution to constitutional law literature on the influence of Ottoman social stratification pattern over 19th Century Turkish constitutional developments. Social stratification pattern that has been inherited from the Ottoman Empire has a great potential to shed a light upon the origins of Turkish constitutionalism in the present day. Furthermore, social startification patterns in the Western countries have been intensively investigated in the political science and constitutional law research within the context of constitutionalization and the emergence of political parties. However, in classical Turkish literature, one can observe that the interconnections between the ancient social stratification and constitutional law are extensively neglected. In this sense, the paper seeks to investigate the Ottoman social stratification in relation with Turkish constitutonal developments in the 19th Century. This paper thus, also aims to challenge the stereotypical argument that Turkish constitutionalism is flourished from top to the bottom.
