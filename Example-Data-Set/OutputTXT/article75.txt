Makale Başlığı: Accession Journey of Turkey to The European Union Membership
Özet: Turkey and the European Union established a good partnership in social, economic, political, and cultural aspects of development. By utilizing historical hermeneutics and examining the accession journey of Turkey into the EU membership, this review aims to assess the possibility of the Turkey admission to the European and gives clarity to Turkey’s stance on the accession process. This review also allows us to understand an aspiring state's journey towards joining an influential global organization and its challenges and efforts for membership. This paper argues that Turkey's journey to EU membership was characterized by uncertainty and vagueness. The possibility of Turkey’s admission to the EU lies in eliminating all the internal and external challenges such as the human rights issue, the Cyprus problem, the approval of the EU members, and all barriers that hindered Turkey’s compliance with the EU accession requirements.
