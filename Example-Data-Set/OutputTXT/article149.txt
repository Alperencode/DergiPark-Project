Makale Başlığı: Performance Analysis of Marine Predators Algorithm for Automatic Voltage Regulator System
Özet: In this study, the emerging, novel marine predators algorithm is proposed to adjust the proportional–integral– derivative controller of the automatic voltage regulator system. With the proposed algorithm, this study aimed to minimize the maximum percent excess of the terminal voltage, settling time, rise time, and steady-state error and improve the transient response of the automatic voltage regulator system with an optimal proportional–integral– derivative controller. The integral of squared error, integral of weighted squared error, squared integral of time, and Zwe-Lee Gaing objective functions were used to set the controller parameters. The performance of the proportional–integral–derivative controller based on the marine predators algorithm was compared with those of the proportional–integral–derivative controllers adapted by different metaheuristic algorithms using various objective functions suggested in the literature. These analyses were conducted using analysis methods such as transient response, root locus, and robustness. The simulation results show better performance in terms of the settling time, over-peak, and stability of the proportional–integral–derivative-controlled automatic voltage regulator system tuned with the marine predators algorithm.
