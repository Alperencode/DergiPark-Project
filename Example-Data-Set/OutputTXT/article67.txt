Makale Başlığı: Examination of The Concepts of Being-in-Itself, Being-for-Itself and Nothingness in The Context of Phenomenology in Jean-Paul Sartre
Özet: Existentialism thought gained importance in 20. century as a result of the consolidation of the idea of freedom due to the troubles after the First and Second World Wars. The basis of this idea is that human existence precedes the essence. An existing person is free in his choices. So he can create his essence by choosing himself. One of the representatives of this thought is also Jean-Paul Charles Aymard Sartre, who introduced the concepts of being-in-itself, being-for-itself and nothingness in his phenomenological ontology method. Sartre creates the phenomenon of being for himself by negating the phenomenon of being in himself. He expresses that a person becomes free by first existing and then rejecting nothingness and that the reality that makes a person a person is formed in this way. The person at the center of the phenomenological ontology, which examining the human as a whole, is responsible with his being-in-itself phenomena and actions of the mind; he is responsible for all their actions in society. In this review article, it is aimed to examine Sartre's thought of being, and contexts of related concepts.
