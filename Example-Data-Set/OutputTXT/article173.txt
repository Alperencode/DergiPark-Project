Makale Başlığı: Mitochondrial Origins of Late Byzantine Burials in Kadıkalesi
Özet: Objective: In the presented study, it was aimed to examine aDNA from human biological materials between the 13th and 15th centuries, obtained from the Kadıkalesi Anaia excavations, and to determine their maternal origins from Mitochondrial DNA. In this way, it was aimed to determine the mitochondrial haplogroups of the region. Methods: For this purpose; The remains of 20 individuals from the archeological excavations in 2016-2018 and dated to the Byzantine period were examined. Anthropometric examinations were first performed on individuals, and then Sanger sequencing of mitochondial HVR1 and HVR2 regions were examined. The obtained sequencing data were evaluated by online programs. Results: According to the result of the study, 12 out of 20 individuals were identified in terms of age, height and gender. As a result of the examination, the maternal haplogroup of 16 individuals was reached and it was found that the majority of them consisted of West Eurasian macrohaplogroups. In addition, two individuals with sub-Saharan haplogroups were identified. Post mortem DNA damage was observed in most of the group .Conclusion: In the present study, genetic information was obtained about the structure of the late Byzantine society in Kadıkalesi Anaia. These results will provide very important information to learn the genetics of the social structure of the period in other excavation areas to be made in the region.
