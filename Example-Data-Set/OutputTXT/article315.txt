Makale Başlığı: REFLECTIONS OF THE CYPRUS PEACE OPERATION TO THE LOCAL PRESS: THE CASE OF MUŞ ŞARK TELGRAF (Orient Telegraph) NEWSPAPER
Özet: While Türkiye became the guarantor state in Cyprus with the Zurich and London Treaties, that role gave Türkiye the opportunity to follow the developments in Cyprus closely and even wanted to organize a military operation to prevent the massacres of the Greeks against the Turks in 1963 and 1967. However, it had to face the obstacles of the USA and the UN at first. On 15 July 1974, following the Nikos Sampson coup in Cyprus, the Hellenic Republic of Cyprus was proclaimed. Türkiye, as a guarantor state against this fait accompli, had to organize a military operation on 20 July 1974. The developments in Cyprus became the most important news topic in the local press as well as in the national press, and Şark Telgraf newspaper, the only local newspaper of Muş in those years, covered the issue extensively in its columns. Present research purports how the I. and II. Cyprus Peace Operations, the Geneva Negotiations and subsequent development were reflected to Muş public by the newspaper, and its attitudes towards the events.  For this purpose, the copies of the newspaper between 15 July and 15 September 1974 were reviewed, the newspaper was taken as the main data source.
