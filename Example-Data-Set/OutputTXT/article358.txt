Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Mycorrhiza, Iron and Zinc Applications on Yield and Agronomic Characters in Peanut (Arachis hypogea L.)
Özet: The exogenous applications of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), iron and zinc have the potential to increase yield in peanut. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of AMF, Fe and Zn combinations on yield and yield components in peanut. Seed coating with AMF and foliar sprays of Fe and Zn were arranged in split-split block design with four replications under farmer’ condition in 2020. The highest values for pod number per plant, pod and kernel yield (kg ha-1) and 100 seed weight were recorded in parcels where AMF, Fe and Zn were applied together. The combination of AMF, Fe and Zn favorable affected maturity date and harvest index. It was highlighted that AMF, Fe and Zn combinations could be used successfully to improve the yield and in peanut cultivation.
