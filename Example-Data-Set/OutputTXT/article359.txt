Makale Başlığı: A Preliminary Study on the Effectiveness of Harpin Protein and Potassium Thiosulphate Foliar Applications on Yield and Quality Characteristics in Second Crop Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.)
Özet: The foliar applications such as harpin protein and potassium thiosulfate (KTS) play a crucial role in cotton growing under especially adversely soil conditions. This study was conducted to evaluate the different combinations of harpin protein and KTS for yield, yield components and fiber quality in second crop cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The differences among treatments were significant for first picking percentage, seed cotton yield and fiber fineness. The applications of harpin protein at peak squaring and harpin protein at first flowering + after 21 days harpin protein were induced the earliness of cotton. The highest seed cotton yield was recorded in harpin protein at peak squaring with 4231.6 kg ha-1, whereas the fibers became coarser with the harpin protein and KTS applications. Results obtained from the current study indicated the potential effect of harpin protein and KTS on increasing the seed cotton yield.
