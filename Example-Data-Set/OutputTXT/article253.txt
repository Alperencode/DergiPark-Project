Makale Başlığı: Sarajevo Primary Schools in The Ottoman Era
Özet: The Ottoman city had a unique structure that contained various institutions and operated them in harmony. The basic institution that brought these features to the Ottoman city was the waqf institution. The waqfs, whose practice dates back to ancient times and whose legal framework was drawn by the Muslims, reached their peak in both law and practice in the Ottoman period. So much so that cities were built with this institution. The basic structures of the Ottoman city, such as mosques, madrasas, schools, baths, inns, and bazaars were built and maintained under the leadership of the waqf institution.Educational activities, which coincide with today's primary and secondary education and carried out under the roof of structures such as primary school, school and mosque in the Ottoman society, were also supported by the waqfs. In the schools, the teacher or teacher of the children, and in the mosques, the imams carried out the education and training of the students. All these activities, from the construction of the schools, to meeting the salaries of the officials and meeting the material and moral needs of the students, were provided by the waqfs. Countless people educated in schools, one of the important institutions of Ottoman cultural and social life, shaped the Ottoman society and state. In this study, schools operating in Sarajevo, one of the important cities of the Ottoman State, will be analyzed in terms of the waqf documents.
