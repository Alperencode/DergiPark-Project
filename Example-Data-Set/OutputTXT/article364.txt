Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Different Phosphorus Doses on Yield and Yield Components and Protein Ratio of Broad Bean (Vicia faba L.)
Özet: Broad beans, which are among the legumes, have nutritional importance with their high protein content. There are limited number of studies on broad bean cultivation in our region. In this study, the effects of phosphorus doses (0-6-9-12-15 kg/da) on yield, yield components and protein ratio of some broad bean cultivars (Tugay-Kıtık 2003-Salkım) were investigated. The study was carried out in the experimental area of Aydın Adnan Menderes University, Faculty of Agriculture, Department of Field Crops in 2019/20 and 2020/21. In the study, it was found that the effects of phosphorus doses on yield components such as the number of pods and the number of pods per plant were significant. In addition, the effect of phosphorus application on grain yield and yield components was found to be significant. The highest average grain yield values were determined as 297.1 kg/da (15 kg/da P) in the first year and 316.1 kg/da (12 kg/da P) in the second year. Phosphorus doses are also effective on grain protein ratio, the average highest values were measured as 24.7% in the first year and 25.3% in the second year from the 12 kg/da phosphorus dose. Close data were obtained from the varieties in grain yield. Salkım gave a higher grain yield than the others in the second year. It was determined that the Tugay stood out in both years in terms of grain protein ratio. As a result, 12 kg/da phosphorus application was the prominent dose in terms of grain yield and protein ratios.
