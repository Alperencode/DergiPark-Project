Makale Başlığı: Selectivity Characteristics of the Sorting Grid in Shrimp Beam Trawls used to Reduce Bycatch in the Sea of Marmara
Özet: Considerable by-catch problems have occurred in the commercial beam trawl fishery targeted at deep water pink shrimp in the Sea of Marmara. In this study, the grid systems were used to reduce the untargeted catch and improve the species' selectivity. By-catch reduction ratios of the beam trawls deployed with and without the grid were compared by the parallel hauling method. Selectivity values of 20 mm bar spacing grid and 24 mm mesh size cod-end were also analyzed by SELNET program. In general, by-catch reduction ratios of the grid beam trawl were determined as 50.6% and 56.9% in terms of number and weight, respectively. The reduction of target catch (Parapenaus longirostris) in the same gear was found to 23.1% in terms of number and 23.2% in terms of weight. In the model for rose shrimp, obtained according to the lowest AIC value, the selectivity parameters of the grid for L50 were 13.51 cm and for SR 4.76 cm. Selectivity parameters of the same species for 24 mm mesh size cod-end were; L50 = 8.99 cm and SR = 5.56 cm. These results indicated that grid usage benefits and contribute to sustainable fishery in the target catch-oriented fishing applications.
