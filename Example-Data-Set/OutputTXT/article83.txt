Makale Başlığı: A SPECTACLE THAT REPRODUCES INEQUALITY: THE PLATFORM AND SQUID GAME
Özet: As a social reality, inequality is one of the themes that is frequently handled in the film and TV series industry. Movies based on this theme aim to explain inequality in a more striking way with a fictional and critical point of view, just like other social problems. The structure of modern cinema, which criticizes the social problems that came to the fore with the 1960s and the social, economic and political reasons that produced them, also shows itself in contemporary works. However, cinema continues to remain in the modern paradox that reproduces the object of criticism through the culture of spectacle. The fact that movies have reached a much more massive reach with the advancing technology and globalization has not reduced the functionality of the paradoxical mechanism of cinema, which reproduces these problems while dealing with social problems. In this study, it is claimed that two popular works that deal with inequality as a social problem and reach large masses with instant access speed of new media tools such as Netflix repeat the mentioned paradox. In this context, the first season of The Platform (Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, 2019) and Squid Game (Hwang Dong-hyuk, 2021) were examined from a critical perspective by following the inverted triangle method within the framework of the mentioned methodology.
