Makale Başlığı: An Inquiry into the Presence of Joint Stock Company in Islamic Economics
Özet: A joint stock company with legal personality, which is counted as a type of equity com-pany in the Turkish Commercial Code, is defined as a type of company whose capital is determined and divided into shares, and which is liable only for its assets due to its debts. İn this study, the economic and fiqhi approaches to the acceptance and adaptation process of the joint stock company, which originally belonged to the legal system and economic system of the West and were transferred to the İslamic world, are questioned. İn this direction, first of all, the historical process of the emergence and development of joint stock companies is explained, and it is shown what kind of needs and purposes cause the existence of joint stock companies and how this process differs in the West and the İslamic world. However, within the framework of the innovations brought by joint stock companies and the basic features they have, the prominent issues to be discussed and the main problem areas to be solved in terms of İslamic law and İslamic economy are emphasized. Due to the simplistic and superficial approach in the adaptation process of joint stock companies that are not an İslamic institution, it is considered that the aims of İslamic law are not taken into account sufficiently and comprehensively, and its existence as an institution in the İslamic economy as such is problematic.
