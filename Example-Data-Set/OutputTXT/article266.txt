Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Factors Predicting Job Satisfaction of School Counselors in Turkey
Özet: is also considered to be important for the school counselling profession because school counsellors’ high level of job satisfaction is assumed to have positive effects not only on them but also on their students and accordingly on the education system. Therefore, it is thought that it is important to examine the factors that predict job satisfaction of school counsellors. For this purpose, this study was conducted on 194 (female=145 and male=49) school counsellors in Turkey. As a result of the research, it was determined that there was a significant positive relationship between school counsellors’ job satisfaction and professional self-esteem and a negative relationship between their job satisfaction and amorality.  In addition, job satisfaction of school counsellors working in the private sector was found to be higher than those working in the public sector. It was found that job satisfaction of school counsellors did not differ significantly according to gender, age and school level variables.
