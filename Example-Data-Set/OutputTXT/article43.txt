Makale Başlığı: A Look at the 'Culture-Communication Relation' and 'Intercultural Communication' Theories
Özet: Today, when the world has become a global village, the expectations of people with different cultural characteristics to live in harmony have made culture and communication inseparable. ‘Language’, which is a symbol representing the common codes of culture and communication, is also a defining element of culture. In a culture where the reproduction and sharing of meaning is very important, language based on verbal expressions is at the foreground. This situation reveals the relationship between communication and culture. While the cultural infrastructure gained through communication allows the development of new technologies, advances in the field of communication accelerated the change of the cultural superstructure. The efforts of people to come together to understand and communicate with each other have revealed intercultural communication. The need to determine the level of communication competence in cultural encounters has paved the way for intercultural communication to be considered as an interdisciplinary field. In order to base this cultural structure on a scientific basis, a need for theoretical perspectives has arisen. In this compilation study, the relationship between culture-communication concepts is discussed and cultural encounters of individuals are explained with intercultural communication theories.
