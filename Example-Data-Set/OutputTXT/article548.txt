Makale Başlığı: Prospective Science Teachers’ Views towards Contemporary Approaches in Science  Education
Özet: The aim of this study is to determine prospective science teachers’ views towards contemporary science education approaches and conducting them. This study consists as a part of the Turkish Science Community 2229 project titled “Contemporary approaches education towards prospective science teachers”. A single group experimental research design was used in this study. At the start of the study, a purposeful sampling method was used while selecting participant prospective science teachers. When choosing science teacher candidates, criteria such as not having participated in a similar study before and their academic success were taken into consideration. The workgroup of this study consists of 30 prospective science teachers studying 3rd and 4th grades in 29 different universities around Turkey. The experimental practice took 8 days and 8 hours each day. Education in experimental practice was given by 11 expert academicians whose expertise was proven by their national/international studies. The applications were conducted by sharing knowledge with prospective science teachers and using effective practices after. The opinion form was used as a data collection tool in this study. The opinion form was applied to prospective science teachers as pre-test and post-test with paper. As a result of the analysis of the data, it was determined that the prospective science teachers' knowledge of contemporary learning approaches was weak at the beginning, but improved positively after the experimental application.
