Makale Başlığı: Examinatıon Of Preservıce Turkish Teachers' Academic Listening Skills
Özet: This study investigated the academic listening skills of preservice Turkish students. The study adopted a survey model. The sample consisted of 90 students from a public university. Data were collected using the Academic Listening Ability Scale (ALAS) developed by Yıldız (2018). The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The results showed that participants had high levels of academic listening ability. Grade level, gender, and parents’ education level had no effect on their ALAS scores.For a holistic evaluation on academic listening, we should examine the academic listening status of students in other departments of education faculties or students in all higher education institutions. More research is warranted to compare the academic listening skills of Turkish language teaching department students from different universities.
