Makale Başlığı: Ethical Status Evaluation of Health Personnel Working in Emergency Health Services
Özet: Objective: This research was conducted to examine the ethical status of health personnel working in emergency health services and the factors affecting them.Methods: 240 emergency health workers participated in the study, which was of descriptive-cross-sectional design. Data were collected with the Individual Description Form and the Ethical Status Scale developed by Forsyth. Data analysis was carried out by number, percentage, independent group t-test and analysis of variance.Results: 43.3% of the participants in the study were emergency medical technicians and 87.1% were working in the emergency health station. The participants' Ethical Status Scale mean idealism value was 37.33±6.02, and the mean relativity value was 37.59±6.33. The average idealism value increases significantly with increasing age and tenure. The mean of relativity increases with the increment in the education level of the participants. It was determined that the significant difference between the occupation of the individuals participating in the study and the sub-dimension of relativity was between doctors and drivers. Conclusion: This study, in which the ethical status of health personnel working in emergency health services was evaluated by applying the ethical status scale, showed that the average of the idealism sub-dimension increases as age and seniority increase, while the mean of the relativity sub-dimension increases as the level of education increases.
