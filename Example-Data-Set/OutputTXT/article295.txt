Makale Başlığı: The determination of the Boehler tuber joint angle and Gissane critical angle in Turkish population according to age and gender
Özet: Aim: Boehler angle and Gissane angle was aimed to determine in Turkish population aged between 18-79 years. Materials and Methods: It is a retrospective study Boehler angle and the Gissane angle measurements were obtained from lateral ankle-foot radiographs taken from 236 healthy population. Results: The significance wasn’t found in both two angle parameters between gender (p=0.283 for the Boehler angle; p=0.485 for the Gissane angle). Additionally, according to age groups, there was a decrease in Boehler angle from decade 1 to the decade 7, the Boehler’s angle increased again. Also, the Gissane angle reached a maximum degree in the decade 7, whereas the lowest value obtained in the decade 2.Conclusion: There were a difference in calcaneal angle reference values in terms of gender, race and age.  The knowledge of the calcaneal angles reference values can provide an important data for clinicians, radiologist and orthopedists with reference and normal values for healthy population.
