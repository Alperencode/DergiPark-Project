Makale Başlığı: The Effects of International Organizations on The Countries Developments: The Case of The Baltic and Central Asia States
Özet: Membership in international organizations is maintained within the framework of the rules that states undertake by entering these organizations. The motivation of states for compliance with these rules is to contribute to the intangible or tangible power capacities of states such as economic development, solution of legal problems, balance of power, privilege in foreign policy. This study aimed to comparatively reveal the extent to which international organizations, in particular the EU and SCO, contribute to the development of their members, based on the examples of Baltic and Central Asian countries. For this, the role of these organizations in the level of economic development of the SCO member states, which were former members of the USSR, now EU member states and formerly USSR member states, has been tried to be examined. From this point of view, international organizations of which it is a member have an impact on the development of a state. Comparing the SCO and the EU in promoting economic development should not be out of the question.
