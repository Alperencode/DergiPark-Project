Makale Başlığı: Insidious Disease Diagnosed 20 Years After Exposure: Silicosis. A Case Report
Özet: Pneumoconiosis is defined as an irreversible disease characterized by the accumulation of inorganic dust in the lungs and the fibrotic tissue response to the accumulated dust. The occurrence of the disease is directly related to the duration of exposure to dust, the amount of dust, its physicochemical properties and dust control measures of the environment. The cause is obvious and it is a completely preventable disease. It is one of the important problems in silicosis, the most common and known type of pneumoconiosis, that it continues to progress even after dust exposure ends. Our case is a 46-year-old male patient who was mainly exposed to silica dust for a total of five years. The detailed history, physical examination, imaging, and laboratory results of the patient who applied for exertional dyspnea after many years of silence were evaluated. In the patient's anamnesis, the history of working in a quartz mine 20 years ago played a key role in the diagnosis together with radiological imaging, and it was decided that he had silicosis after excluding some diseases included in the differential diagnosis. We wanted to draw attention to the fact that in such cases, the progression of the disease after exposure, the ability to remain silent for decades, and most importantly, the detailed work history of the patients helps the diagnosis.
