Makale Başlığı: Multiple Nonnegative  Solutions for  a Class of Fourth-Order BVPs Via a New Topological Approach
Özet: In this paper, we study  a class of fourth-order boundary value problems with integral boundary conditions.The nonlinearity may have time-singularity and change sign. Moreover, it satisfies general polynomial growth conditions. A new topological approach is applied to prove the existence of at least two nonnegative classical solutions. An example of application illustrates the existence result.
