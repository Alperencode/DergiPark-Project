On the other hand, invention of the commercial papers caused the expansion of trade volume above the amount of money supply. Birth and development of the negotiable instruments law followed a parallel course with the needs of societies and negotiable instruments law reached its current state. For instance, draft (süftece), check (sakk) and money orders were used facilitating circulation of money in the first century of Islam. While draft and money-credit orders eliminated drawbacks of the money transporting between cities, checks became a payment instrument which is used widely in the commercial life.

In this study, it is aimed to reveal the roles of the negotiable instruments in terms of commercial law of Ottoman Empire and Islamic World. In addition, the latest regulations made in Turkey’s Commercial Law are explained as general.
