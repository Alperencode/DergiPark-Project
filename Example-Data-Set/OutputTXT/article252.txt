Makale Başlığı: Authentication and Authorship Sstems in Online Assessment:  Experiences of University Students
Özet: The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of using an authentication and authorship system in online assessment activities on students’ opinions and to identify students’ user experiences. The study was carried out within the context of the TeSLA Project (An Adaptive Trust-Based e-Assessment System for Learning), which was developed under an H2020 project funded by the European Commission. The TeSLA System, which contains face recognition, voice recognition, keystroke dynamics, forensic analysis, and plagiarism tools in online assessment, was tested during a semester in 12 undergraduate and graduate courses in various faculties of a state university in Turkey. The study participants were 231 university students using the TeSLA system in the first phase of the third pilot study. In the study, which was designed as survey research, the data were collected before and after the implementation through a pre and post-questionnaire. The data were analyzed via paired samples t-Test and ANOVA. The analysis was conducted item by item. As a result, the TeSLA experience appears to positively change students’ views in terms of satisfaction, trust, confidence in sharing personal data, reducing cheating and plagiarism in online assessment, and advantages of an online assessment. On the other hand, the TeSLA experience had a negative impact on the issues students were worried about, causing these concerns to increase. The findings obtained based on these results were discussed within the scope of the relevant literature.
