Makale Başlığı: Analysis of False Religious Posts on Social Media
Özet: Today, social media users interact with each other by sharing religious information as in every field. Users who are interested in religious issues share their feelings and thoughts through actions such as performing some religious practices or participating in religious issues in the virtual environment. The need to obtain religious information and inform other users about them has led to an increase in religious shares on social media. The posts in question are sometimes created with discourses that refer to religion, but with wrong content. These posts, which establish inconsistent relations with religious sources, spread rapidly in the virtual environment and reach countless users. The main problem of the study, which focuses on the appearance of religious phenomena in social media and their perception, at this point is to identify the wrong posts that threaten the religious rituals of individuals and to question their compatibility with religious sources. For this purpose, Facebook application, which has millions of users in Turkey, was chosen as a sample. As a result of the study, which was designed according to the content analysis model, one of the qualitative research methods, it was seen that religious content posts generally have a sacred discourse, but some of them are false posts.
