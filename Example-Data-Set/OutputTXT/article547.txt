Makale Başlığı: A Psychometric Comparison of Sato Test Theory with Classical Test Theory and Item Response Theory
Özet: The aim of this study was to comparing the psychometric properties of the mathematics subtest items of the Determining of Students Achievement Exam and the performance / achievement / ability levels of the students who took the mathematic subtest with Sato Test Theory (STT), Classical Test Theory (CTT) and Item Response Theory (IRT) indicators. The research was conducted on 15461 8th grade students who participated in the exam in 2005. The data of this study were analyzed by examining the correlations between item discriminations, item difficulties and individual characteristics calculated in the context of different test theories. In addition, problematic test items were analyzed by clustering and observing common elements. After the analysis, it was seen that Sato Test Theory produced similar results with other theories many times in terms of determining item and individual characteristics. Moreover, some advantages related to theory were also suggested in the study. The results obtained support the claims in the literature that STT can be considered as an alternative test theory that can allow valid and reliable measurements with predictions that robust and do not contradict with other test theories.
