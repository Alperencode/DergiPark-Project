Makale Başlığı: Isolated Spontaneous Basilar Artery Dissection: A Case Report
Özet: Cervical, vertebral and cranial artery dissection is a rare etiology of ischemic stroke. In this case report, we aimed to discuss a case of spontaneous basilar artery dissection presenting with pons stroke in the light of current literature. A 52-year-old male patient was brought to our clinic because of loss of consciousness after syncope. Physical examination showed he was unconscious and had Glasgow coma score of  9 (verbal 3, motor 3, eye 3). Brain computed tomography imaging with intravenous contrast was performed after orotracheal intubation. Thrombus formation at the level of the basilar artery and possible dissection phleb were observed in the brain computed tomography with intravenous contrast. Bacillary artery dissection was confirmed in the patient who underwent cranial digital subtraction angiography. The patient underwent endovascular thrombectomy. The patient was discharged after seventy-seven days of hospitalization. As a conclusion; basilar artery dissections are rare lesions associated with significant morbidity and death. The nature and treatment options of basilar artery dissection are significantly different from other dissections due to its perforating branches and localization.
