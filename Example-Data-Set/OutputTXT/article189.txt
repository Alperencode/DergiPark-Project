Makale Başlığı: Retrospective Analysis of Patients Operated for Peptic Ulcer Perforation: Single Center Results
Özet: IntroductionPeptic ulcer perforation is a full-thickness defect in mucosa due to excessive gastric acid production or decreased mucosal defense. Mortality and morbidity increase in peptic ulcer perforation due to delayed diagnosis and treatment. This study aimed to present our experience with patients who underwent surgery for peptic ulcer perforation in our clinic. Material-MethodThe data of patients who underwent surgery for peptic ulcer perforation between May 2020 and January 2022 in our clinic were retrospectively analyzed.ResultsA total of 20 patients, 4 (20%) female and 16 (80%) male were included in the study. The median age of the patients was 47.5 (27-90). The median operative time was 45 (30-75) minutes. In 17 (85%) patients, the defect was repaired with an omental patch, and in 3 (15%) patients with a falciform patch. The mean hospital stay was 3.5 (2-5) days. ConclusionSurgical techniques to be applied in treating peptic ulcer perforation are various, and the most preferred method is omental patch repair by laparotomy. In addition, Helicobacter pylori eradication treatment and control should be performed to prevent recurrence of perforation.
