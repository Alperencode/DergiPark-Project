Makale Başlığı: The Effects of Birth Preparation Education on Women's Delivery Type and Views about Birth
Özet: Objective: To examine the effects of birth preparation education on women's and delivery type views about birth.Method: This study was conducted in a case-control design with 100 (Education: 50 and Control: 50) women who were selected by convenience sampling method, who were in a state hospital to receive prenatal care between May 2019 and December 2020.Results: It was found that the education and control groups had statistically similar vaginal delivery (28.0% and 46.0%) (χ²= 3.475; p= 0.062) and voluntary caesarean section (13.9% vs. 33.3%; χ²= 3.375; p= 0.066) rates. When the effect of contributing variables was kept constant, it was found that participation in prenatal education classes increased vaginal deliveries 1.8 times (OR= 1.833; 95% CI= 0.724-4.641), but this result was not statistically significant (p> 0.05). It was determined that women in the education group received more psycho-social support (12.0% versus 0.0%) compared to the control group and these differences were statistically significant (t= 2.53, p <0.05). Similarly, effects on mother-baby interaction (26.0%), breast feeding / breastfeeding success (46.0%), physical comfort (18.0%), ability to move freely / stand up quickly (16.0%), and cope with contractions were reported. They were found to be similar in terms of their positive experiences in managing the birth (18.0%) and being able to care for the baby (4.0%).Conclusion: In this study, it was found that the birth preparation class did not affect delivery type, increased psycho-social support intake and did not affect physical experiences.
