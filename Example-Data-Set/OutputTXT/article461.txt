Makale Başlığı: Investigation of the Effect of Using Ultrasonic Fuel System on Exhaust Emissions in a Spark Ignition Engine
Özet: Fragmentation and mixing of the fuel used in spark ignition engines with air is highly effective on combustion and exhaust emissions. Studies are carried out on fuel systems in order to prepare the ideal air-fuel mixture ratio suitable for different operating conditions of the engine. In this study, ultrasonic fuel system was used as an alternative to the traditional fuel systems used in spark ignition engines. The average droplet diameter of 20-30 µm in the injector fuel system used in spark ignition engines has been realized as 12 µm with ultrasonic fragmentation. The engine was run at ½ constant load at different speeds with ultrasonic, carburetor and injection fuel systems, and exhaust emissions were measured. The maximum values of the measured exhaust emissions for the three fuel systems were examined comparatively. When the ultrasonic fuel system is used, there is a 99% reduction in CO, 60% in HC, 18% in NOx, 10% and an increase in CO2 compared to the carburetor system, 99% reduction in CO, 12% in CO2, and 45% in HC compared to the injector system. It was observed that there was a 55% increase in NOx. In general, it has been determined that the ultrasonic fuel system has a positive effect on exhaust emissions.
