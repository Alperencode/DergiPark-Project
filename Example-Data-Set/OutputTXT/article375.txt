Makale Başlığı: Determination  of Angstorm Coefficients with curve fitting method  by using Matlab Program
Özet: For the sustainable development of nations and to lessen the negative environmental effects of fossil fuels, more clean and renewable energy sources are now required. One of the most significant energy sources is solar energy. To utilize solar energy more efficiently in a particular area, it is crucial to be aware of the solar radiation levels. Furthermore, it's critical to accurately calculate solar energy for study into climate change, one of the biggest global challenges. Systems that utilize solar energy are frequently used nowadays to address the rising global need for energy. The high geographical and temporal resolution, global, diffuse, and direct sunlight data needed for the design and effective operation of solar power plants are now provided by satellite-based solar radiation predictions. In this work, satellite-based forecasting models were used to estimate diffuse solar radiation for the chosen region. In this study, the solar radiation irradiance values of the chosen region were estimated using the curve fitting approach. Angstorm coefficients were determined using the Matlab program for this investigation. Various statistical error analysis tests were used to evaluate how well the constructed model performed. The findings collected unequivocally demonstrate that the provided prediction models perform well.
