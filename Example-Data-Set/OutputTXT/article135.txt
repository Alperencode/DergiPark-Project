Makale Başlığı: Beyşehir Lake (Isparta-Konya, Türkiye) Fishing from Past to Present and Situation Analysis
Özet: Beyşehir Lake, located in one of the important karstic discharge basins of the Anatolian Plate, is Turkey's largest freshwater lake with a surface area of 650 km2, and is a very important wetland in terms of bio-ecological, socio-economic, and cultural aspects. Although the first records on Beyşehir Lake fishery date back to the 1910s, the first scientific findings on fisheries began in the 1950s. Although it is challenging to reach reliable data about the fishery of Lake Beyşehir, the main processes that have been effective in fishing from the 1950s to the present are: i) used fishing gear and methods, ii) changes in the trophic structure of the lake, iii) foreign fauna elements entering the lake, iv) the lake water level changes, v) fishermen's socio-economic and awareness level, vi) fisheries management strategies. The lake's catch yield was nearly 3 kg/ha in the 1950s, and it was determined as 13.34 kg/ha in 2021. While there have been significant changes in the fauna in the intervening time, it has been determined that there has been a substantial increase in the number of fishermen with the increasing amount of catch. Today, 23 fish species, 14 of which are endemic, live in the lake, which is at the mesotrophic-eutrophic level in terms of trophic status. The average catch amount between 2010 and 2021 was 669.051 kg/year. 67.41% of this amount was composed of Carassius gibelio (Prussian carp), 20.17% of Sander lucioperca (pike-perch), and 12.42% of Cyprinus carpio (carp). In 2021, the last fishing season, 75.41% of the caught species were Prussian carp, 21.47% pike-perch, and 3.11% carp. 385 fishermen are actively fishing in the lake, and according to the data of 2021, it has been determined that the fishermen have earned 13,970 TL/year in return for 2.252 kg/year of catch. As another result of this study, it has been understood that the most significant factor in the fishing ecosystem of Beyşehir Lake is untimely and excessive fishing.
