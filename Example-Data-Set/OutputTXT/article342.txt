Makale Başlığı: Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation for Geriatric Dogs: Current View
Özet: Geriatric and arthritic dogs have special rehabilitation needs. In these dogs the functional status worsens because of the progressive loss of movement. Aging triggers changes in a wide variety of tissues. The incidence and severity of chronic diseases increase over time. Animals that reach 75% of the predicted lifespan are defined as geriatric. The aging process is affected by breed, genetics, nutrition, environment, and other factors. The life expectancy of dogs has increased due to medical and surgical advances in veterinary medicine. As a result owners are faced with a number of problems related to old age. While many pets are active during adolescence, most dogs begin to show signs of aging around the age of 6. Geriatric dogs with this condition are candidates for comprehensive evaluation and rehabilitation. Geriatric and arthritic dogs should be evaluated regularly to detect changes in their condition and to design the most accurate treatment plan. Pain and limitations are often seen in geriatric dogs, and their quality of life decreases. The use of pain management guidelines, multimodal medication, physical rehabilitation modalities and environmental changes ensures the dog has a quality life. Rehabilitation goals for aging dogs include promoting health, slowing the onset or progression of age-related health problems, and improving the dog's quality of life—if possible, life expectancy. This study emphasized the effects of aging, common musculoskeletal changes in the aging dog, quality of life, pain management and rehabilitation process of the arthritic dog.
