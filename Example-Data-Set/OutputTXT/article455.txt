Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Olivine Mineral's Use in Ceramic Glazes and Applications
Özet: Olivine, which has been used in industry since the 1930s, is a mineral type that takes its name from the Olive color. Olivine has gained increasing importance in the industry over time and has gained an important place as the Olivine industry all over the world today. The chemical compound of commercial Olivine contains 45-50% Magnesium Oxide, 40-43% Silicon Dioxide, 8% Iron Oxide and 1-2% glow loss. The fact that the olivine mineral is environmentally friendly, has a significant potential in terms of reserves in Turkey and has not been used in ceramic glazes before are important parts of the study. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the usability of olivine mineral in glaze making. In the research, alkaline, alkaline-boron and boron glazes consisting of basic raw materials such as albite, orthoclase, petalite, calcined borax, colemanite and boric acid were prepared using the experimental method. Olivine is used in glaze recipes by adding 10-50-80%. The glaze mixtures prepared were applied to the test tablets shaped with ESC 1 Code white tile casting clay and fired at 1150°C. As a result of the study, faultless glazes were made with a maximum of 50% Olivine contribution. The glazes obtained from the test results were evaluated according to surface properties such as glossy, matte, crackle, and the study was supported by presenting them in the text.
