Makale Başlığı: Non-Muslims Before the Qadi of Naxos: Lawsuits and Complaints on Interpersonal Relations (17th-18th Centuries)
Özet: From the end of the sixteenth century, Ottoman sultans began to appoint qadis to the island of Naxos, where the population consisted of Catholic elites and Orthodox Greek people. The main question of this article, in which I focus on the activity of the qadi in such a social stratification, is: What did the qadi, who was to apply the shari‘a rules and act as the deputy head of the island, in a place where there were no Muslims except for a few families, faced in terms of legal practice? In this article, I will first review the issue of non-Muslim subjects (dhimmis) applying to the qadi court in Ottoman legal history studies. Afterward, I will present some preliminary information on the socio-economic and administrative structure of Naxos from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. I will then take up some legal issues and introduce and analyze some of the conflicts among non-Muslims on the island that were found in the rulings addressed to the qadi of Naxos in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. These disputes are related to the rights arising from the contract, inheritance, disposition of waqf properties, and easements on the goods.
