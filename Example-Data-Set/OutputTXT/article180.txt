Makale Başlığı: Relation of CHA2DS2 -VASc score with severity and complexity of coronary artery disease in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction
Özet: Objectives: This study aimed to determine the correlation between CHA2DS2 -VASc score and the Synergy between PCI with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) scoring system for predicting severity and complexity of coronary artery disease in patients with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted in a tertiary care center. The patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with NSTEMI and who underwent the PCI were included. The patients’ demographic, clinical and angiographic characteristics were gathered from the hospital electronic medical records. Echocardiography and angiography images were evaluated by an experienced interventional cardiologist blinded to the patients' clinical information. The CHA2DS2-VASc and SYNTAX scores were calculated. The primary outcome of this study was the correlation between the CHA2DS2-VASc and SYNTAX scores. Results: A total of 216 patients were included. The mean CHA2DS2-VASc and SYNTAX scores were 2.9±1.7 and 16.6±7.9, respectively. There were significant differences in the mean CHA2DS2-VASc scores between the low and moderate (2.8±1.7 and 3.4±1.7, respectively, p<0.001), and low and high-risk groups (2.8±1.7 and 3.7±1.8, respectively, p<0.001) according to the SYNTAX score risk classification. The rank correlation analysis showed a significant positive correlation between the CHA2DS2-VASc and SYNTAX scores (Spearman’s rho= 0.454, p=0.02). Conclusion: This study showed a fair, positive correlation between the CHA2DS2-VASc and SYNTAX scores. The use CHA2DS2-VASc score might be practical to predict the severity and complexity of coronary artery disease in patients admitted to the ED with NSTEMI.
