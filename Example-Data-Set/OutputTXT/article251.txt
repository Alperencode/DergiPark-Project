Makale Başlığı: Two Church Bells from Antalya: Traces of the Religious Soundscape of the Late Ottoman Period
Özet: This article examines two church bells found in Antalya. One hangs at the top of the Antalya clock tower while the other is on display at the Antalya Toy Museum. These two artefacts, which have not received any serious scholarly attention, were surely employed in Orthodox churches until 1923, when the population exchangebetween Turkey and Greece led to the conversion or demolition of most churches in the city. The two instruments are first described and then contextualized in the period that witnessed their use - the very end of the Late Ottoman period.
