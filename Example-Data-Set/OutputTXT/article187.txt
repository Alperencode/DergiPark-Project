Makale Başlığı: DO THE LEVELS OF cffDNA FRACTION CHANGE IN PREGNANCIES WITH PLACENTAL PROBLEMS?
Özet: Aim : To investigate the value of the cell free fetal DNA (cff-DNA) for determining the important obstetric complications such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and, preterm labor other than prenatal screening of fetal aneuploidies. Material and Methods : Our single center- retrospective study included 131 pregnant women in their 10-24th weeks of gestation, between  the dates September 2019 and March 2020 who applied for cff-DNA analysis (HarmonyTM Prenatal Test; Ariosa Diagnostics Inc., San Jose, Calif., USA) with indications including advanced maternal age (≥40) and high risk for trisomy 13, 18 and 21 according to the results of  the first trimester prenatal screening or solely on their own desire.Results :  Oligohydraamnios was observed in 10 (%8,1)  patients, gestational diabetes in  10 patients (%8,1) , preeclampsia in 7 ( %8,6) patients and ablatio plasenta in 2 (%1,2) patients in this study. Increasing levels of the extracellular fetal DNA fractions in 10-24th gestational weeks showed statistically significant correlation  for predicting the risk for IUGR (p< 0.01). There was not a statistically significant difference between the level of extracellular fetal DNA fractions and the other obstetric complications (preeclampsia, preterm labor, GDM, oligohydraamnios).  Conclusion  : Although cff-DNA has many valuable implications as a novel  biomarker for prenatal screening for special fetal aneuploidies,  the association between the levels of cff-DNA and the risk of  obstetric complications in clinical practice has not been clarified yet . Further studies should aim to investigate the cff-DNA levels in patients with  pathological obstetric conditions in order to detect its potential predictive value and diagnostic implementation.
