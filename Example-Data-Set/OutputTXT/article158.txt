Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and Calcium Levels and Idiopathic Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo
Özet: Aim: We aimed to compare 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D) and Ca2+ levels of patients admitted to our clinic with the complaint of dizziness and diagnosed with idiopathic benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) with those of healthy control group without dizziness and investigate the role of Ca2+ and 25-OH vitamin D in the development of BPPV.Material and methods: This study is a retrospective case-control study. The study sample consisted of 409 patients admitted to Alanya Training and Research Hospital Neurology outpatient clinic and diagnosed with idiopathic BPPV between 01.01.2018 and 01.08.2021, and of 338 control patients without any physician consultation due to vertigo, dizziness or imbalance in the last 1 year before admission to our clinic and whose serum vitamin D levels were measured, the Chi-square and T-test were utilized for statistical analysis.Results: Mean blood 25-OH vitamin D levels were 15.74 ng/mL and 17.91 ng/mL in BPPV and control groups, respectively. Serum 25-OH vitamin D levels were significantly lower in BPPV group than control group (p=0.01, p<0.05). Mean serum Ca2+ levels did not exhibit any difference in BPPV and control groups.Conclusion: Decreased serum levels of 25-OH vitamin D have been associated with the occurrence of BPPV independently of other key markers.
