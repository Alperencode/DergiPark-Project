Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTS OF VARIETY, ENVIRONMENT AND PLANT DENSITY APPLICATIONS ON KERNEL QUALITY CRITERIA IN PODS WITH DIFFERENT STATISTICAL ANALYZES
Özet: In this study, grain quality criteria of two broad bean cultivars (Salkım and Fontes) at six different plant densities (40x15, 40x20, 50x15, 50x20, 60x15, 60x20) were investigated in two different locations (Kahramanmaraş and Şanlıurfa). The experiment was set up in a factorial pattern according to the randomized blocks design. As a result of the experiment, the ash, oil, moisture, protein and starch values of the broad bean varieties varied between 3.47-3.80%, 1.02-1.84%, 10.10-11.60%, 25.95-31.37% and 41.06-45.16%, respectively. In the correlation analysis, it was determined that the relationship between starch and ash properties was important except for the properties of other properties. In addition, it was determined that the level of significance of the interaction between features varies according to the factors. In the PCA (Principle Component Analysis) results, it was noted that each location formed separate groups and the characteristics of the samples examined within the groups were distributed according to the dominance status. In general, it was observed that the values of all features in Şanlıurfa location were higher than the values of the samples in Kahramanmaraş location. Significant differences were determined in the oil, moisture and protein properties of the cultivars. It was determined that while the cluster variety was higher only in oil properties than Fontes, it was significantly lower in moisture and protein properties. It was noted that the differences in all traits in the inter-row and in-row distances were insignificant. According to these results, it was understood that the varieties used and plant densities significantly affected the quality criteria according to the locations. Quality criteria are affected by many factors. As a result of the analyzes we have used, it has been concluded that studies with multiple factors can be evaluated in a single platform in correlation analysis and PCA applications.
