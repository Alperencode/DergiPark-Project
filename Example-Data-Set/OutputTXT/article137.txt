Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Production and Economic Indicators of Rainbow Trout Farming in Türkiye
Özet: This study aims to reveal the contribution of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), according to production volumes, values, number of farmers, and capacities. Total fisheries and aquaculture production in the world were 178 and 87.5 million tons in 2020 respectively. Rainbow trout is produced in 77 countries in the world, with a production amount of approximately 1.02 million tons in 2020. Within this field, Iran was first with 197 203 tons, followed by Turkey with 144 283 tons in 2020. When viewed from a “10-year of change” aspect, the amount of aquaculture in Turkey increased from 212.410 tons in 2012 to 471 686 tons in 2021. Rainbow trout accounts for 35% of total aquaculture production in 2021. This species is cultured in 68 cities in Turkey. There are 493 rainbow trout hatcheries in 58 cities across the country with a total production capacity of 1,435 billion fries. Elazığ (26,500 tons; 16%) comes first in rainbow trout farming followed by Muğla (22,000 tons; 13%); Samsun (13,045 tons; 8%), Trabzon (9,800 tons; 4.6%) and Şanlıurfa (7.658 tons; 4%). It has been determined that the price of rainbow trout cultured in inland waters during the years 2012 and 2021 ranged between 44.99-24.14 TRY (2.71-2.78 USD), while rainbow trout cultured offshore sea cages ranged between 6.78-32.83 TRY (3.69-3.78 USD). The economic contributions of inland and off-shore-cage rainbow aquaculture are 3 238 960 360 TRY (363.611.540 USD) and 1 034 440 470 TRY (116 268 210 USD), respectively. The total contribution of rainbow trout to the economy was 4 273 400 830 TRY (479 879 750 USD).  In off-shore cage aquaculture, rainbow trout are grown over kilograms in the Black Sea, and are traded with the name of "Turkish Salmon (Somon)". It would be beneficial for Turkey to focus its future plans on the following points to consolidate its world position in the production of rainbow trout registered as "Turkish Salmon". These may include taking initiatives to protect existing markets and opening up new markets, carrying out environmentally sustainable use of water resources considering their carrying-capacities and using local alternatives/on-site production methods to minimize aquaculture production inputs such as raw materials - energy - fuel.
