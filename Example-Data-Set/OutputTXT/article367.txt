Makale Başlığı: The Effect of Glyphosate Applications on Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud (Common Reed) at Different Periods
Özet: This study was carried out to determine the effect of applying glyphosate potassium salt (441 g/l) in different periods on the control of Phragmites australis, which has great density in irrigation and drainage channels. In pot studies initiated using two-node rhizomes, herbicide applications made at a dose of 1000 ml/da when the common reed reached 5-7, 30-40, 50-60 and 85-100 cm in length and as a result, evaluations were made in the number of tillers, aboveground fresh and dry weights, rhizome fresh and dry weights, rhizome node numbers along with visual observations compared by the  control. As a result, it was concluded that for the applications to be effective, it is necessary to wait for newly grown plants to reach approximately 50 cm in length. It has been observed that the applications made in the 5-7 cm period did not provide sufficient effect in the common reed control
