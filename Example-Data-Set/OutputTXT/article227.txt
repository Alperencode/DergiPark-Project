Makale Başlığı: Is a Consensual Divorce a Matter of Law Without Dispute?
Özet: Non-contentious jurisdiction is regulated between Articles 382 and 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The contractual divorce regulated in paragraph 3 of Article 166 of the Turkish Civil Code is not included in the uncontested judicial affairs listed in Article 382/2 of the Code of Civil Procedure. However, this does not prevent the uncontested divorce from being evaluated in terms of uncontested jurisdiction. As a matter of fact, the works falling within one or more of the non-contentious judicial criteria listed in Article 382/1 of the Code of Civil Procedure are also considered as non-contestious judicial work. In this context, the question of whether a consensual divorce is a judicial matter without dispute will be tried to be answered. In this respect, first of all, the concepts of non-contested jurisdiction and uncontested divorce will be examined. Later, the contracted divorce will be handled as both non-contested judicial work and contested jurisdiction (lawsuit), and the opinions in the doctrine and certain decisions of the Supreme Court will be included in this regard. Finally, by presenting our opinions and suggestions on the subject, this issue, in which the problems of substantive law and procedural law are intertwined, will be tried to be clarified.
