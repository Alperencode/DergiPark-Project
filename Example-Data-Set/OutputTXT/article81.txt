Makale Başlığı: ANALYSIS OF TALENT COMPETITIVENESS PERFORMANCES OF G20 COUNTRIES: AN APPLICATION WITH CRITIC-BASED COCOSO METHOD
Özet: The activities of countries with large economies on talent competitiveness can affect global capital and the economy. Therefore, the measurement of talent competitiveness performances of large economies is of great importance. In this context, the CRITIC-based COCOSO method measured the talent competitiveness performances of 19 countries in the G20 group, the world's largest economies, over the values of the Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI) components for 2021. According to the findings, it has been determined that the top three countries with the best talent competitiveness performance are the USA, Australia and Germany, respectively. In the study, it was also determined that the countries with above average talent competitiveness performance values within the scope of the CRITIC-based COCOSO method are the USA, Australia, Germany, France, South Korea and China. Accordingly, it was concluded that countries below the average value should increase their talent competitiveness performance in order to increase their contribution to the global economy. In terms of the method, it was evaluated that the GTCI values of the countries could be explained in general terms with the CRITIC-based COCOSO method, according to the findings.
