Makale Başlığı: DETERMINING THE OIL PRICE INDEX MODEL STRUCTURE
Özet: The change in oil prices, which has a significant share in energy consumption, and the macro-economic variables of countries are directly or indirectly affected. Uncertainties and sudden changes in the economic structure have different effects depending on the importer/exporter structure of the countries and their position in international trade. Within the scope of the study, the data regarding the West Texas Intermediate crude oil traded in the New York Stock Exchange between January 24, 1986 and May 24, 2021 are examined, and the change in oil prices is revealed in two stages. First, a comparison between the models was made by considering SETAR, MTAR (Momentum TAR) belonging to the self-threshold autoregressive TAR family, and LSTAR, which is one of the soft-transition autoregressive STAR models, which are nonlinear models on the average, and the transition between regimes was interpreted by choosing SETAR as the most suitable model. In the second stage, it is revealed to reveal the nonlinear structure of the structural changes in oil prices with the Markov regime change model. According to the findings, it is concluded that the WTI oil variable exhibits a bi-regime nonlinear structure.
