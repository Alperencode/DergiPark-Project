Makale Başlığı: Determining Clinical Comfort, Worry and Status of Liking Children among Pediatric Nursing Students: Case of Two Different Universities
Özet: Purpose: The aim of this study is to determine clinical comfort, worry and status of liking children among pediatric nursing students studying in universities located in east and west of Turkey. Methods: The data of this descriptive and correlational study were collected in nursing faculties located in east (A University) and west (B University) provinces between April-May 2020. The sample of the study consisted of 211 students who participated in the online survey voluntarily between the specified dates. The data of the study were collected using “Sociodemographic Characteristics Form”, “Clinical Comfort and Worry Assessment Tool of Pediatric Nursing Students” and “Barnett Liking of Children Scale (BLCS)”. Results: In the study, the comfort subscale mean score was higher in the nursing students studying in the University B and the difference was found to be statistically significant (p<0.05). Although BLCS mean score was higher in the nursing students studying in the University A, the result was not statistically significant (p>0.05). It was determined that there was a statistically positive moderate significant correlation between levels of liking children and the comfort subscale and a statistically negative moderate significant correlation between levels of liking children and the worry subscale in nursing students studying in the Universities A and B. Conclusions: It was found that the liking of children status of the students studying in the Universities A and B was high. Students' levels of stress, anxiety and liking children in the pediatric clinic rotation should be determined.
