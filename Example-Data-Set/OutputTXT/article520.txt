Makale Başlığı: Fusion Rates in Lumbar Disc Prosthesis Applied by posterior approach
Özet: Purpose: In lumbar herniation which requires surgery, only simple discectomy may be sufficient; however, lumbar disc prostheses are used to protect the continuity of movement at the relevant level and to prevent recurrence and development of adjacent level disease. In this study, the fusion rates of lumbar disc prostheses applied by posterior approach were evaluated.Materials and Methods: Patients who underwent single-level lumbar disc prosthesis in Yozgat Bozok University School of Medicine Hospital between June 1, 2016 and October 31, 2020 were retrospectively scanned. The presence of fusion development was determined based on the computerized tomography examinations. SPSS 25 was used for statistical analysis, chi-square and linear regression tests were performed.Results: A total of 94 patients were included in the study. 48 of them (51%) were male and 46 of them (48.9%) were female. It was determined that prosthesis was applied to Lumbar (L)3-4 (n=9), L4-5 (n=60) and L5-Sacral(S)1 (n=25) levels. 12 patients (12.7%) had a previous history of discectomy. It was determined that fusion developed in 10 (10.6%) patients. The mean fusion development time was 13±6.6 months (minimum 2-maximum 25 months). There was no statistically significant difference between fusion development and age, gender, follow-up period and previous operation history (p=0.15, p=0.20, p=0.24 and p=0.35, respectively). Conclusion: In lumbar disc prostheses applied posteriorly, fusion can develop at a considerable rate, even for a very short time such as 2 months. The rate of fusion development was not related to gender, age, follow-up period, and history of previous discectomy.
