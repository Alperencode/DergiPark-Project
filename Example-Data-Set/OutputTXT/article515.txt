Makale Başlığı: The Frequency of Cardiac Involvement in Children with Henoch-Schonlein Purpura
Özet: Purpose: Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) is the most common vasculitis in childhood. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and type of cardiac involvement in HSP.Materials and Methods: Thirty-eight children with HSP (patient group) and 20 healthy children (control group) were included in the study. Physical examination, electrocardiography (ECG), echocardiography (ECHO), and 24-hour ECG monitoring (Holter monitoring) were performed.Results: The mean age of patient and control groups were 9.3±3.2 years (range: 4-17 years) and 9.7±3 years (range: 4-14 years), respectively. Also, the female to male ratios were 1.37 and 0.66, respectively. The percentages of involvement of systems and organs were as follows: skin 100%, joint 71%, gastrointestinal system 71%, and kidney 31%. The mean heart rate (MHR) in ECG was significantly higher in the patient group (p=0.03). The mean values of maximum aortic valve velocity (AOVmax.) and maximum pulmonary valve velocity (PULMVmax.) were significantly lower in the patient group than the control group (p=0.02, p=0.03) in the ECHO examination. However, systolic and diastolic cardiac functions were similar between the groups (p>0.05). In the patient group minimal pericardial effusion was detected in only one case. In 24-hour Holter monitoring MHR values (p=0.79) and heart rate variability parameters were similar between the patient and control groups (p=0.60, p=0.57). Also, no clinically important arrhythmia and other conduction disorders were detected in both groups.Conclusion: Cardiac involvement in patients with HSP is not common. The patients may be assessed with the ECHO if signs and symptoms related to cardiac involvement were observed.
