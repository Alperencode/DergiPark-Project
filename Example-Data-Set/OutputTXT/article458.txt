Makale Başlığı: Strategic Element Enrichments in Hallaçlar Volcanites (Bayramiç, Çanakkale)
Özet: In this study, Hallaçlar Volcanites located in Bayramiç-Çanakkale region were evaluated in terms of strategic element contents. Mineralogical-petrographical and geochemical investigations were carried out on the samples which were taken from the outcrops with intense hydrothermal alteration. The stratigraphy of the study area consists of the Sütüven Formation (Kazdağı Metamorfites), Çetmi Ophiolitic Melange, Evciler Pluton and Hallaçlar Volcanites. The intensity of hydrothermal alterations gradually increases in Hallaçlar Volcanites towards to the ophiolitic rocks and the Evciler Pluton. As a result of the geochemical analyzes carried out, it was observed that the yttrium (Y), zirconium (Zr), thorium (Th), tin (Sn) and antimony (Sb) elements were enriched in the Hallaçlar volcanites. It can be concluded that these elements were enriched in the volcanites with the hydrothermal solutions leaching from the elder metamorphic rocks.
