Makale Başlığı: Investigation Of Perlite Added Ceramic Body Properties
Özet: Perlite is a type of volcanic glass that is formed in nature as a result of the cooling of magma lava and contains water droplets in its structure. It is a raw material that is not harmful to health, is environmentally friendly, and is easy to use because it is produced at high temperatures. The properties of this raw material that enable it to be used in many fields of industry have formed the factors determining the study titled "Investigation of Perlite Added Ceramic Body Properties". In the art of ceramics, while the artists create their clay; they add alternative materials to provide flexibility, reduce the weight of large-sized forms, and provide different textures and aesthetic qualities. There are a wide variety of organic and inorganic raw materials added to the body. This study, it was aimed to determine the usability and additive ratios of perlite in ceramic bodies. Body recipes were prepared by adding 0%, 3%, 5%, and 7% perlite to chamotte and casting slip. The prepared bodies were fired at 950°C and 1200°C. Perlite-added bodies were compared with perlite-free bodies, and total shrinkage and water absorption tests were carried out. As a result of the experiments carried out in line with the study; It has been observed that 7% perlite additive causes deformation in casting slip, and no deformation occurs at all additive ratios in chamotte. It has been observed that perlite additive has positive effects on color and sintering properties in both clay types, regardless of firing temperature.
