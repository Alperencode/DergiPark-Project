Makale Başlığı: EVALUATION OF STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT CULTURE IN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THROUGH STRATEGIC PLANNING AND ANNUAL REPORTS: CASE OF TR90 REGION MUNICIPALITIES
Özet: In today's world, strategic management, which is considered to have a very important role in reaching the goals of institutions and has been used by businesses operating in the private sector for many years, seems to have taken its place in public administration and especially in municipal management. However, although it has taken its place in public institutions as a concept, the issue of whether strategic management as a corporate culture has become a corporate culture is considered as a subject to be investigated. In this context, in this study, it has been tried to investigate to what extent the basic strategic management concepts are included in the strategic plans and activity reports of the municipalities. In this context, 28 basic concepts related to strategic management were determined by literature review. Then, with the content analysis technique, which is one of the qualitative research methods, it was tried to determine the level of these concepts in the documents examined within the scope of the study. Within the scope of the study, the 2015-2019 and 2020-2024 strategic plans and 2019 and 2020 annual reports of the provinces of Artvin, Giresun, Gümüşhane, Ordu, Rize and Trabzon in the TR90 region were examined. Although it has been determined that some concepts related to strategic management are included in the strategic plan and activity reports examined in the study, it is considered that this level is not sufficient. In addition, it has been observed that there are differences between the strategic plan and activity reports in the context of using the concepts related to strategic management by different municipalities.
