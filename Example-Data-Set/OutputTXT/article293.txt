Makale Başlığı: The effect of cold application to the sacral area on labor pain and labor process: A randomized controlled trial
Özet: Aim: This study aims to determine the effect of cold application to the sacral area in the first stage of labor on labor pain and process.Materials and Methods: The study was done as a randomized controlled experimental study. While the women in the experimental group received cold application for 10 minutes every 20 minutes after 4 cm of cervical dilatation, the women in control group received routine care protocol of the unit.Results: The pregnant women in experimental group showed statistically significantly low score of pain on the 40th (p=0.041), 100th (p<0.001), and 160th (p=0.014) minutes and had statistically significantly shorter delivery time (p<0.001) in comparison to the control group. It was also found that dilatation and effacement happened in statistically significantly shorter time in the experimental group (p<0.05).Conclusion: Cold application to the sacral area of pregnant women in the first stage of labor reduces labor pain, shortens labor time, and shortens dilatation and effacement time.
