Makale Başlığı: Banded Bowls from Tepebağ Höyük (Cilicia Pedias)
Özet: Tepebağ Höyük, located in Cilicia Pedias, has revealed different types of bowl forms classified as “Banded Bowls” in the literature of ancient pottery. In this article, banded bowls from the mound are categorized, according to their rims, into five groups: “simple”, “inverted”, “high”, “flat” and “everted-rounded”. High-rim bowls are further divided into two subgroups: “angular rim” and “rounded rim”. In the region, the earliest examples of these banded bowls are dated to the 7th century BC while the latest examples to the 4th century BC. The Tepebağ banded-bowl examples are known from many centers in the Eastern Mediterranean region, but this constitutes the first study on this subject for the Adana region. The banded bowls from Tepebağ have been dated between the 6th and 4th century BC based on the stratigraphic layers of the site.
