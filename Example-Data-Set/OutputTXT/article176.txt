Özet: Objectives: Since recurrent implantation failure (RIF) is a challenging fact, effects of different therapeutic immunomodulatory agents are being investigated to overcome this problem. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of intralipid on pregnancy outcomes of IVF patients with RIF.Methods: 116 of the participants who received only the short antagonist protocol allocated in the control group, whereas 106 patients were in intralipid group by additionally receiving intravenous lipid (SMOFlipid®). Intralipid was given on the day of embryo transfer, on the day of positive pregnancy test and continued weekly until the tenth week of pregnancy. Implantation rate, biochemical pregnancy rate, clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate were evaluated.Results: The positive pregnancy test, clinical pregnancy rate and live birth rate were statistically significantly higher (p<0.001) in the intralipid group (50.9% vs. 22.4%, 41.5% vs. 19.8%, 29.2% vs. 10.3%, respectively). There was no significantly difference between groups in terms of implantation, spontaneous abortion , multiple pregnancy and chemical pregnancy rates (p>0.05).Conclusions:  This study revealed that intralipid therapy has better pregnancy outcomes in patients with RIF compared to patients undergo standard IVF protocol only. Further prospective studies are needed to suggest the routine use of intralipid in patients with RIF.
