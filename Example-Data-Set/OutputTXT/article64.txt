Makale Başlığı: Ideological Impact in News Discourse: The Case Of Suicide News
Özet: The development of communication technologies and the widespread use of mass media and media have brought about the definition of the media as the fourth force. The media, which contributes to the development of pluralist democracy, has very important functions such as informing, informing, educating and forming public opinion. However, the commercialization and monopolization of the media and its becoming a part of the dominant structure have created the problem of media's being drawn into the field of ideological struggle. The ownership structure of the media has led to the effective use of media contents as a tool of ideological manipulation in the news production processes, in other words, the transformation of the media into a tool of the capitalist dominant system. In this study, in which the discourse analysis technique, which is one of the qualitative research methods, was used, the ideological discourses in the news of four adult siblings (Sözcü, Yeni Akit, Sabah, Cumhuriyet) who were included in the sample, as a result of the suicide of four adult siblings in Fatih district of Istanbul on 5 November 2019, were examined. As a result of the analysis made within the scope of the study, it was seen that the newspapers in the sample violated the principle of objectivity, which is one of the basic ethical codes of journalism, in their news about the suicide incident in question, and they often included ideological discourses in their news texts.
