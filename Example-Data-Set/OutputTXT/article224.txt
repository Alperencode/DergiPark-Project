Makale Başlığı: The Effects of the Amendments Made by Law no. 7392 and no. 7416 on the Responsibilities of the Online Multi-Sided Platforms as Intermediary Service Providers and on Consumers
Özet: With the development of technology and the internet becoming an inseparable part of human life, it has become quite common for consumers to make legal transactions without physically meeting with goods or service vendors/providers. These transactions are usually carried out through many different online multi-sided platforms such as Amazon, Trendyol, Yemeksepeti, which facilitate the daily tasks of individual consumers. Today, it is seen that almost every consumer uses at least one of these platforms. This relationship is expressed as a distance contract within the scope of the Law on Consumer Protection No. 4077 and as an e-contract within the scope of the Law on the Regulation of E-Commerce No. 6563, and the relevant laws have determined some responsibilities for online multi-sided platforms that are intermediary service providers in this relationship. It has become necessary to adapt the responsibilities determined in this field, which are suitable for change and development, to keep up with the times. For this reason, specific changes were made to the laws mentioned above in 2022. In this study, it is discussed how the amendments to the Law on Consumers Protection and the Law on the Regulation of E-Commerce shape the responsibilities of online multi-sided platforms as intermediary service providers and how this new responsibility mechanism affects the consumers in e-commerce.
