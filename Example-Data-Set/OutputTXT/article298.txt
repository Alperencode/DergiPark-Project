Makale Başlığı: Comparison of the effects of sugammadex and neostigmine on recovery of anesthesia in rigid bronchoscopy in pediatric cases
Özet: Aim: To compare the efficacy of sugammadex and neostigmine, which are used to reverse rocuronium- neuromuscular blockade in children who underwent rigid bronchoscopy due to tracheobronchial foreign body aspiration.Materials and Methods: The data of 54 patients who underwent rigid bronchoscopy with the suspicion of foreign body aspiration in children aged 0-18 in our hospital between 2013 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed.Results: Thirty of the cases were male and 24 were female. Atropine-neostigmine was administered to 23 patients and sugammadex was administered to 31 patients to reverse neuromuscular blockade. While no complications were found in 41 cases, bronchospasm was found in 6 cases, hypoxia in 5 cases, and laryngospasm in 2 cases. Recovery time was shorter in patients who received sugammadex (p<0.001).Conclusion: Recovery time is shorter after sugammadex administration in reversing rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade in pediatric rigid bronchoscopy anesthesia.
