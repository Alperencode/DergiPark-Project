Makale Başlığı: GLASS CEILING SYNDROME PERCEPTIONS OF INFORMATION CENTER STAFF: A RESEARCH ON UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES
Özet: Changes and developments in the social sense have enabled women to take more part in working life compared to past. Despite this, women have not been able to rise in their careers at the same rate and have not progressed in management levels. Considering that women's place in society should primarily be a mother and a wife and pressure on women creates obstacles for them to progress in their career steps. There are mentalities in society that still cannot imagine women in working life. This mentality brings with it prejudices against women. The aim of this study is to try to reveal the glass ceiling syndrome perceptions of the staff of Mediterranean Region university libraries. For this purpose, the current situation regarding the perspectives and awareness of the librarians about the career barriers of women has been tried to be revealed with the descriptive statistics. In addition, Mann Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests were performed to examine whether there is a difference between the answers given by the library staff to the attitude questions about career barriers, according to their gender, marital status, age, title and how many years they have worked in the sector.
