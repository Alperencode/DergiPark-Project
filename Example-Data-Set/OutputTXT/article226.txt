Makale Başlığı: Evaluation Of The Judicial Procedure To Be Applied In The Trial Where The Re-Registration Of The Company Is Requested For The Purpose Of Additional Liquidation
Özet: According to Turkish law, commercial companies gain legal personality when they are registered with the trade registry in Turkish law. Companies that continue their activities are terminated by the realization of one of the reasons specified in the law or the contract and enter the liquidation phase.  After the completion of the liquidation phase, the company title is deleted from the trade registry. However, if it is understood that it is compulsory to carry out additional liquidation transactions after its closure, it is under adjustment that the last liquidators, members of the board of directors, shareholders or creditors may request the re-registration of the company from the commercial court of first instance in the place where the company's head office is located, until these additional transactions are concluded. For this reason, the legal nature of the request for the re-registration of the company for the purpose of an additional liquidation request, or the “ihya davası” as it is called in practice, has been tried to be evaluated. As a result of these evaluations, it has been concluded that the request for re-deferment of the company to the registry for the purpose of additional liquidation is in the nature of an Non-contentious proceeding act. In addition, since it is an ex parte proceeding, the simple trial procedure will be applied and the ex officio investigation principle is valid.
