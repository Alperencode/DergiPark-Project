Makale Başlığı: Capturing the Seen and Unseen in the Beldibi Rock Art
Özet: This article examines the engravings of the Beldibi Rock Shelter using digital techniques. The engravings, which consist of a jumping deer and an ox with its head turned back, were first discovered by E. Bostancı in 1959. Both Bostancı and Anati compared them to Western European Upper Palaeolithic figures. If the engravings of Beldibi really exist, they would exhibit the earliest rock art in Anatolia.
