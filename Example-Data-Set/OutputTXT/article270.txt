Makale Başlığı: The Anatomical Surveys on the Two Salvia L. Species (Sect. Hymenosphace, Sect. Hemisphace) Spreading in Mardin (Turkey)
Özet: In this study, we investigated two Salvia species (sect. Hymenosphace, sect. Hemisphace) distributed in the province of Mardin in the Southeastern Anatolia Region in terms of anatomy. These species are S. multicaulis Vahl. (sect. Hymenosphace) and S. russellii Benth. (sect. Hemisphace). For anatomical investigation, cross-sections taken from roots, stems, leaves, and petioles of the taxa were examined under a light microscope. In anatomical examinations, it was observed that root, stem, leaf, and petiole structures of the taxa were similar but shapes and measurements as well as the the number of tissue layers and pith rows were different. In addition, it was observed that the surface of the S. multicaulis species was covered by multicellular and compound hairs. In conclusion, anatomical characters provide information of taxonomic importance, and especially hairiness is important in species differentiation.
