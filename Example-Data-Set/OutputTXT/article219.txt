Makale Başlığı: From Colomb to Refugees Europe Between 1492-1850 and the Subjects without Freedom and Security
Özet: The expaditions to find new trade routes in the begining of XVI. century pawed the way for a restructuring movement with the Renaissance and Reformation. With these reformation revolutions, states, production methods, economy and ultimately life itself were re-designed. The universality of human rights is still a topic of discussion today. The debate is being renewed and gaining dimensions with current crises. In the study, the reason for the continuation of the discussions on freedom and security, which comes to mind first when human rights are mentioned, has been sought in the history of the above mentioned period, and an evaluation has been made in the axis of the refugee debates which will possibly remain a topic in the near future.
