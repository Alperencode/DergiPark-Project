Makale Başlığı: Investigation of Some Morphometric and Meristic Features in The Population of Alburnus Sellal Heckel, 1843 Inhabiting Özlüce Dam Lake (Elazığ-Bingöl, Türkiye)
Özet: In this study, it was aimed to determine some morphometric and meristic characteristics of individuals belonging to Alburnus sellal Heckel, 1843 species, which was caught from Özlüce Dam Lake, the main stream of which is Peri Stream. Some morphometric features and their ratios to each other in 135 A. sellal individuals were calculated as mean, maximum, minimum, standard deviation, standard error and coefficient of variation. In addition, the percentile ratio of some body measurements to standard length, the regression equations and the correlation coefficients were calculated and it was determined that there were strong positive relations. In meristic features, lateral line (80-88) and the number of scales in the transversal direction (13-17/5-7), the number of simple and soft rays on the fins (dorsal III/8-9, ventral I-II/8-9, pectoral I/14-17, anal III/11-15), the number of rakes in the first gill arch (13-18), the row and number of pharyngeal teeth (2.5-5.2) by being detected, descriptive features of the species were determined.
