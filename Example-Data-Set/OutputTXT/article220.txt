Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of Legal Presumptions That Shift the Burden of Proof in the Context of Presumption of Innocence
Özet: Legal presumptions that enable a conclusion to be drawn about the existence of a fact based on a known fact, are included in the legal systems of every state. Sometimes it can be seen that a crime is established through legal presumptions. These kind of presumptions called presumptions of guilt. Since a presumption of guilt establishes a presumption that the person charged with a crime is guilty, the accused must prove that he or she is not guilty to elude a conviction. Presumption of innocence, that known as a normative fact that everyone charged with a crime is innocent until proven otherwise, necessitates that prosecution has to endure the burden of proof that the person accused have commited the crime. In this regard presumptions of guilt are incompatible with necessitates of presumption of innocence. Nevertheless, according to well established case law of ECHR and CCRT, application of presumptions of guilt does not categorically constitutes a violation of the presumption of innocence. When application of presumptions of guilt that reverse the burden of proof stand within the certain limits, there will be no violation of presumption of innocence.
