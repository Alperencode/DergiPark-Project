Makale Başlığı: The Relationship of Smoking and Lymph Node Metastasis with Survival in Colorectal Cancers
Özet: Purpose: Colorectal cancers, which are one of the most common types of cancer, take the first ranks in terms of mortality. Various factors, such as smoking, are considered risk factors in CRC. In this study, germline mutations in 18 genes were examined by Next Generation Sequencing analysis and the role played by smoking and genetic effects in colon cancers were compared. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, paraffin blocks of 50 patients with colon cancer that were followed up in between 2010 and 2018 were included. The bioinformatics program SOPHiA DDM® was used for next-generation sequencing. The data of the study were evaluated by the IBM SPSS Statistics Standard Concurrent User V 25 (IBM Corp, Armonk, New York, USA) statistics program.Results: In the study, it was concluded that the presence of APC and MUTYH genetic mutations was 3.083 times more common in patients with distant organ metastasis compared to patients without metastasis and these patients exhibited 6.364 times more TP53 genetic mutations. Also, a relationship was found between APC, MUTYH, and MSH2 and tumor stage. There was no statistically significant relationship between smoking status and Colon Ca patients with and without distant organ metastasis. Conclusion: APC and MUTYH were found to have a bad effect on overall survival. It was determined that there was a significant relationship between the patients' grade, stage, and overall survival status. A significant relationship was found between the expected survey of age and grade in patients with distant organ metastasis.
