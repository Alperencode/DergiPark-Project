Makale Başlığı: SCIENCE AS THE WALL OF “METAPHYSICS” IN THE CONTEXT OF ISLAMIC THOUGHT
Özet: In the tradition of Islamic thought, metaphysics is a science that aims to reach the knowledge of the non-matter. Science, on the other hand, is the active element that prevents the connection between the ideal-real world to be broken. In this direction, the aim of the study is to evaluate why and how science can be a periphery to metaphysics, depending on the question of “what is metaphysics” in the tradition of Islamic thought. Literature scanning or document review method was used. The first is a system of abstraction in the metaphysical, material environment in the tradition of Islamic thought, in which the Truth has made itself accepted, approved and adopted. The second is that science is the periphery both to protect the parameters of the material environment and to strengthen the rational, experiential and pragmatic dynamism of this tradition.
