Özet: The aim of the research is to determine the perceptions and views of parents on emergency distance education during the Covid-19 pandemic. For this purpose, parents' metaphorical perceptions and positive and negative thoughts about emergency distance education were determined. The research was carried out on the basis of case study and phenomenology designs, which are qualitative research designs. The study group consisted of 57 parents from many different professions, education levels, and cities. The data were obtained with a metaphorical perception form and a semi-structured interview form. As a result of the analysis of the data, it was determined that the parents had both positive and negative perceptions of emergency distance education. While some parents defined emergency distance education with positive metaphors such as lifebuoy and savior, others used negative metaphors such as nightmare or torture. It has been stated that emergency distance education has many negative effects related to affective, educational, technical, health-related, interactional, private life, and the strain of working parents. Positive effects are categorized as instructional, interaction, savings, health, flexibility, personal development, affective effects, and other positive effects.
