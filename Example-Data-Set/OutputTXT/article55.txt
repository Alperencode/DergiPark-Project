Makale Başlığı: A Rare Medicolegal Cause of Acute Abdomen: Gossypiboma Causing Enteroenteric and Enterocutaneous Fistula
Özet: Gossypiboma are surgical tampons that are forgotten in the operation area and cause serious complications in the patient. The most frequently forgotten foreign body in operations are surgical tampons. Early recognition of gossypiboma is important to minimize the risk of morbidity and mortality in the patient. While they may be asymptomatic, they may cause complications such as perforation, obstruction, peritonitis, intra-abdominal or enterocutaneous fistula, abscess and sepsis. In the differential diagnosis, hematoma, pseudocyst and tumors should be considered. In computed tomography (CT), the spongy appearance formed as a result of the air trapped in the cotton pad is characteristic. Its treatment is surgery. If possible, the use of radiopaque labeled tampons can be avoided by taking preventive measures such as careful counting of surgical materials before and after each surgical operation. It should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of gossypiboma in patients with a history of previous surgery and diagnosed with an intra-abdominal mass.
