Makale Başlığı: Evaluation of the Effects of Lighting Sources Used in Night Work on Occupational Health and Safety; Metal Industry Example
Özet:  Especially with the increase in the workload in the working environment, the unsuitability of the environmental factors affecting the working environment paves the way for occupational accidents. Although various business lines have their own risk factors, environmental risk factors have a direct or indirect effect on occupational accidents in almost all areas. The lighting factor, which affects the working environment conditions and is one of the environmental risk factors, is one of the most important factors affecting the eyesight of the employees. The lighting factor plays a major role in many of the occupational accidents that occur especially in workplaces where night work is intense. In the studies, it has been determined that the lighting factor has a share of 23.8% among the factors affecting occupational accidents. In this study, the illumination levels of the lighting sources used in the regions where night work is carried out in a determined metal sector were measured with a suitable measuring device and analyzed. According to the measurement results, 30% of the working areas were determined as very dangerous, 50% as dangerous and the remaining 20% as non-hazardous. The results obtained were discussed in the light of the literature and the precautions to be taken were suggested.
