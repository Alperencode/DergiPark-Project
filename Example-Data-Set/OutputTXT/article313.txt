Makale Başlığı: A NEW PARADİGM IN ANATOLIAN CULTURE: PERİNATAL SOCİAL WORK
Özet: Perinatal Social Work (PSW) protects and improves the health of infants, mothers, and families before and after birth. Families require a great deal of assistance when their child is born. Those who become moms for the first time, in particular, face a lack of information and expertise in child care. This qualitative study was carried out by asking semi-structured interview questions to 53 participants selected using the snowball sampling approach in Kahramanmaraş, one of Turkey's urban cities. The acquired data were examined using the MAXQDA 2020 program. They indicated that the participants need assistance with child care and that they received this assistance with intensity from family elders. The need for PSW has evolved in order to offer help to the family in child care and to address this quandary. It is advised that PSW be used to implement PSW in our nation by creating a professional definition.
