Makale Başlığı: Economy, Morality and Capitalizm
Özet: Mankind; despite his superiority over all other beings with his knowledge, skills, values, ability to make choices and planned production, his economic activities in line with his values have become threatening the future of himself and the Planet he lives on. However, while there was no such problem in the thousands of years of history from the existence of humanity to the Industrial Revolution, it should not be a coincidence that the aforementioned dire results emerged in a short period of time dominated by Capitalism, which has defined itself as immoral in the last 150 years. It is not possible to explain this negative process independently of the close relationship of human beings with the capitalist economic system, which lacks moral consciousness, is far from social responsibility, observes individual interests instead of social benefit, and aims at profit maximization and capital accumulation in this direction. Therefore, in this study; first of all, human-ethics, morals-economics and economics-human relations and their mutual interaction were discussed, then social and environmental problems caused by accepted immorality in the society and economic system were tried to be revealed. Finally, in order to overcome these problems, new understandings that need to be realized in social values, social responsibility understanding and economic thought have been tried to be established with logical inferences in the light of scientific datas.
