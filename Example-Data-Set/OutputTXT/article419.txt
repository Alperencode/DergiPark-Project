Makale Başlığı: Visualization and Social Effects of Forest Fires: Media Representations of 2021 Great Antalya-Manavgat Fires
Özet: Natural disasters are sources of hesitation among people from past to present due to their strong psychological effects. It would take years to eliminate the negative consequences of natural disasters such as forest fires mainly because, in addition to the economic and psychological drawbacks experienced by victims of such fires, social life as a whole becomes cut off from its natural flow. As technology becomes an indispensable part of our social life, crises tend to be solved as soon as possible while informing others about such hazardous events. Following these disasters, social formulations towards solving these problems and reconstructive processes such as power dynamics and fragilities appear throughout such procedures. Hence, in this study, visual representations found in media following the 2021 Great Antalya-Manavgat Fires are collected and analyzed to understand societal perspectives on this disaster. The study sample includes the news given on the fires, namely, on hurriyet.com.tr and Twitter, the leading interactive platform in the world. Content analysis was used to understand the processes of intervention, struggle with deficiency, neglect, and opportunism, all interconnected in collaboration and societal cooperation against the devastating effects of these fires.
