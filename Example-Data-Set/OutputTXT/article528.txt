Makale Başlığı: The Effects of COVID-19 in Chronic Kidney Disease: Progression and Increased Severity of Chronic Inflammatory
Özet: Purpose: SARS-COV-2 (Severe acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus) has a wide organotropism. Although it predominantly affects the pulmonary system, it is commonly involved in the kidneys. Studies have shown that it increases acute kidney injury and mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, its effects on the progression and severity of chronic inflammation in patients who survived and were followed up without dialysis are not yet known. Our aim in the study is to investigate kidney functions and the severity of chronic inflammation in post-COVID CKD.Materials and Methods: The study was carried out retrospectively. Two groups were created as COVID-CKD(n=54) and NONCOVID CKD (control group)(n=60). Basal Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN), Urea, Creatinine (Cre), Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), White Blood Cell (WBC), Neutrophil (Neu), Lymphocyte (Ly), Platelet (Plt), Plt/Ly ratio (PLR), and Neu/Ly Ratio (NLR) levels were analyzed and compared. Changes in the same parameters were analyzed in the groups, 6 months after the acute infection.Results: An increase in Cre (p=0.002) and PLR (p=0.02) and a decrease in Ly (p=0.037) and GFR (p=0.001) were observed 6 months after acute infection in the COVID-CKD group. No changes were detected in the NON-COVID group. A positive correlation was found between PLR-NLR and BUN, Cre, and Urea, whilst a negative correlation was detected between PLR-NLR and GFR.Conclusions: Progression and severity of chronic inflammation increased in SARS-COV-2 infected-survivor, non-dialysis followedup CKD patients.
