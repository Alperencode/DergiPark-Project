Makale Başlığı: A histopathological examination of kidney and bladder tissues of 75-day female Sprague Dawley rats exposed to a one-hour continuous 900 MHz electromagnetic field during the prenatal period
Özet: Aim: The effects on kidney and bladder tissues in postnatal adulthood in rats exposed to 900 MHz electromagnetic field (EMF) in the prenatal period were investigatedMaterials and Methods: Eighteen female rats; were divided into three groups, control, sham and EMF. The EMF group was exposed to 900 MHz EMF for 1 hour/day during the prenatal period. Sham group pregnant rats were kept in the EMF system closed cage. No procedure was performed on the control pregnant group rats and postnatal newborns. At the end of the experimental period, kidney and bladder tissues were evaluated histopathologically.Results: Kidney and bladder specimens from the control and sham groups exhibited a normal morphological structure. Tubular and glomerular damage, dilatation in Bowman's space in kidney tissue and degeneration of the urothelial epithelium in the bladder were observed in the EMF group.Conclusion: We think that exposure to 900 MHz EMF during the prenatal period may cause severe histopathological changes in kidney and bladder tissue in adulthood.
