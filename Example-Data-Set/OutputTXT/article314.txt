Makale Başlığı: THE EFFECT OF SOCIAL MEDIA USE ON ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS RATING OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS
Özet: With the acceleration of globalization, access to information has increased and accessibility to information has become much easier. In this process, social interactions and the use of social media have become widespread in Turkey as well as all over the world. The generation defined as the Z generation shows great interest in the use of social media, and the mobility and information flow here are guiding on issues such as their individual preferences, cultural norms, and social development. On the one hand, the Z generation, which experiences socio-cultural globalization intensively, also faces global and local-regional environmental problems and the consequences of these problems. Environmental awareness of individuals who encounter environmental problems can vary according to various parameters such as gender, age, scale of place of residence, income level and occupation. However, it is very important for the current young generation to be aware of these problems and to take measures to solve the problems, to take a leading role in raising awareness, and to demonstrate the will to take collective action in the solution of environmental problems. One of the channels where young people can achieve this is the social media they actively use. It is expected that the environmental awareness of young people, who can easily access information such as photographs, videos or texts related to environmental sustainability in social media applications, and trainings and activities aimed at raising environmental awareness, will increase. In this context, the subject of the study is to investigate the effect of social media on the environmental awareness of university students called Z generation.
