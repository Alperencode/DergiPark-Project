Makale Başlığı: The Relationship Between Teachers' Levels of Readiness for Change and the Innovativeness Levels of Schools
Özet: The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between teachers' readiness for change and their perceptions of their school's innovativeness. The sample of the research consists of 591 teachers working in two districts of Istanbul. “Teachers’ Readiness for Change Scale” and “Innovative School Scale” were used in the research. Descriptive statistics, correlation and stepwise regression analysis were used in the analysis of the data. According to the findings, it was determined that the level of teachers’ readiness for change and teachers' perceptions of the innovativeness level of their schools were high. As a result of the correlation analysis, it was found that there was a positive, high-level and significant relationship between the two variables. As a result of stepwise regression analysis, it was seen that all the scores of the sub-dimensions of readiness for change, readiness in terms of intention, cognitive readiness and emotional readiness were a significant predictor of the innovative school scale score. The findings were discussed in the light of the relevant literature and suggestions were presented.
