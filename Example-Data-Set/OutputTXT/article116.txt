Makale Başlığı: Relationship Between Cognitive Flexibility, Anxiety Sensitivity and Coronaphobia
Özet: OBJECTIVE: In this study, it was aimed to determine relationship two transdiagnostic factors (anxiety sensitivity and cognitive flexibility) between Coronavirus-19 (COVİD-19) phobia.METHOD: For the study, the forms were sent to social media groups with 4,000 and 3,500 people on social media, and the participants were selected by the simple random sampling method. 280 volunteers who met the inclusion criteria were accepted. Sociodemographic Data Form, Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), COVID-19 Phobia Scale was used to evaluate the volunteers.RESULT: 161 male and 101 female volunteers participated in the study. Both sexes have similar characteristics regarding age, marital status, and years of education. In the correlation analyses, positive correlations were found between coronaphobia scale total scores and ASI- physical (r=.584), ASI- cognitive (r=.556), ASI- social (r=.524), ASI-total (r=.609), whereas a negative correlation was found between coronaphobia scale total scores and CF-alternatives (r=-.232), CF-control (r=-.375), CF-total (r=-.328). Stepwise regression analysis was applied with ASI and CFI subscales to predict coronaphobia scale scores.  According to the results, ASI-physical (β=.287), ASI-cognitive (β= .178) positive and CF-control (β=-.148) negatively predicted coronaphobia total scores significantly {F(7, 254) = 23,361, p < .01) , with an R 2 of .375DISCUSSION:  Our results were shown that sub-tpye of transdiagnostik factors were more closely related to coronophobia and even predicted.
