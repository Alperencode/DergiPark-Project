Makale Başlığı: The UN Security Council From The Perspective of World-Systems Analysis
Özet: In this study, the function/role of the UN Security Council in the world-system is examined. In the theoretical framework, World-Systems Analysis has been used. Besides, dialectical/historical materialism is preferred in the study. The primary objectives of this study can be claimed as: First, it will be questioned how the UN Security Council plays a role in maintaining the status quo at the systemic level. The second is researching whether the UN Security Council is an important mechanism in core-periphery relations. The main conclusions are as follows: The structure of the UN Security Council has changed after Russia’s and China’s integration into capitalism. Therefore, Russia and China should be evaluated as a part of the “center”. Thus, the UN Security Council can be defined as “center” holistically. Within this context, the UN Security Council is a functional tool that controls the periphery. The structure and role of the UN Security Council are under severe criticism and might undergo a serious reform process.
