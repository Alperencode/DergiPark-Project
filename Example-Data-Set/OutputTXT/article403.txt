Makale Başlığı: Determination of Factors Affecting Aflatoxin Formation in Peanuts and Preventive Measures
Özet: In our research article, where we present the results of our project study, sampling was carried out for two years from a total of 45 fields located in 3 different regions and altitudes in 2020 in order to determine the effect of climatic and geographical conditions on aflatoxin formation. As a result of intensive analysis, aflatoxin was found in seven samples when peanuts were just collected and it was found above 5 μg/kg, which is the maximum limit value of the contaminants communique. However, it was determined that these values were not very high and that total aflatoxin remained below the maximum limit value of 10 μg/kg. The number of samples in which aflatoxin was found below the minimum detection level in all samples was 27. By evaluating all the data obtained, the factors affecting the formation of aflatoxin were monitored and preventive measures were determined. As a result of these studies, scientific information has been produced and included in this report, not only for aflatoxin-free peanuts, but also for better quality peanut production.
