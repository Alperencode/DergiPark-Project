According to the research results, the curriculum fidelity levels of teachers are at a medium level in sub-dimensions of adherence, duration and program differentiation while they have a high level of curriculum fidelity in the sub-dimensions of quality of program delivery, participant responsiveness, teacher training and school climate. According to MANOVA results it was found that there were no significant differences in teachers’ curriculum fidelity levels according to gender, the faculty they graduated from and having postgraduate degree.
