Makale Başlığı: IMPROVING THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF POLYESTER FABRIC BY USING  PUMICE, AMORPHOUS SİLİCA AND COLEMANİTE ADDITIVE PRINTING AND SOL GEL METHODS
Özet: Today, the use of low-cost, environmentally friendly and natural-based materials as an alternative to conventional methods and the development of the properties of the final products come to the fore in the textile sector, as in other sectors. In this study, 100% polyester woven fabric samples were coated with pigment printing technique using solid particle pumice, amorphous silica and colemanite additives and printing fixation was carried out by sol gel method. After the printing processes carried out with different additive ratios, the surface analyzes of the existing fabric samples were made and the results obtained were evaluated by comparing their strength, abrasion resistance, UV protection and air permeability properties. As a result, a new process step has been created, which has the possibilities of use in different areas, low temperature and low energy cost, and allows the use of minimum chemicals.
