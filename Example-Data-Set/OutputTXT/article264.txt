This study was designed according to a relational survey research design and included 147 teacher candidates. In the study, data were collected through lesson plans, the number of reflections on the discussion board, final test scores, and the perception of proficiency in planning the instruction scale and analyzed using the Multiple Linear Regression analyzes. This study found positive and significant correlations among the final grades of teacher candidates, their lesson plan grades, the number of their reflections on the discussion board, and the perceived proficiency of teacher candidates in the planning the instruction scale.
